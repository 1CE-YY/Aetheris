这是 Java 学习路线的 2025 最新版，每年都会根据当下 Java 后端求职和招聘的最新要求进⾏全⾯
的优化和改进。
这篇⽂章可能是你所⻅过的最⽤⼼、最全⾯的 Java 后端学习路线，共 4w+ 字。不过，也不⽤担⼼
内容太多学不完，我会按照学习难度给出找⼀份⼩⼚⼯作必学的内容以及适合循序渐进提⾼ Java 
后端开发能⼒的学习路线。
对于初学者，你可以按照这篇⽂章推荐的学习路线和资料进⾏系统性的学习；对于有经验的开发
者，你可以根据这篇⽂章更⼀步地深⼊学习 Java 后端开发，提升个⼈竞争⼒。
为了保证内容的不⾄于太杂，这篇⽂章不会涉及到学习⽅法以及学习⽹站的推荐，可以看我之前写
的下⾯这⼏篇⽂章：
我是怎么学习编程的？
我常⽤的 20+个学习编程的⽹站！芜湖起⻜！
程序员如何快速学习新技术？
这篇⽂章也不会涉及到计算机基础的内容，关于计算机基础知识的学习可以参考我的⽹站上的分
享，地址：https://javaguide.cn/books/cs-basics.html 。
多说⼀句：对于编程初学者，我不太建议上来通过做项⽬学习。实践确实很重要，如果你没有编程
基础的话，直接上⼿实战，很容易最后学个四不像。建议你在学习编程的初期尽量多看⼀些优质视
频。跟着视频⼀步⼀步⾛，可以让你少踩很多坑，学习编程的信⼼也会增加。
Java 后端学习路线概览  
我画了⼀张图，先简单带⼤家看看 Java 后端学习路线的全貌以及我所推荐的学习顺序。
下图中涉及到的每⼀个知识点都会在下⽂中详细介绍（附带学习资源推荐）。上⾯这张图⽚的原图+PDF 版本，可以在公众号「JavaGuide」后台回复“学习路线”获取。

四不像。建议你在学习编程的初期尽量多看⼀些优质视
频。跟着视频⼀步⼀步⾛，可以让你少踩很多坑，学习编程的信⼼也会增加。
Java 后端学习路线概览  
我画了⼀张图，先简单带⼤家看看 Java 后端学习路线的全貌以及我所推荐的学习顺序。
下图中涉及到的每⼀个知识点都会在下⽂中详细介绍（附带学习资源推荐）。上⾯这张图⽚的原图+PDF 版本，可以在公众号「JavaGuide」后台回复“学习路线”获取。内容⽐较多？劝退？ 如果你只想找到⼀份⼩⼚的开发⼯作的话，建议你把重⼼放在 Java 基础、数
据库、常⽤框架、常⽤⼯具上。
像 JVM、分布式、⾼并发、⾼可⽤、微服务这些知识点，如果你想进⼤⼚或者说让⾃⼰在求职的时
候更有竞争⼒，那你就也是要多花⼀点时间来学习的。
现在⾯试很卷，想要找到⼀个好⼯作的话，就需要你去多学⼀点，多练习⼀点。虽然，你⽬前学的
很多知识，在你⼯作之后可能⽤不到，但是，⾯试的筛选就需要你会这些。毕竟，很多岗位是很多
⼈⼀起竞争，为了达到筛选效果，⾯试难度通常都会⽐较⼤的。这也就是所谓的：“⾯试造⽕箭，⼊
职拧螺丝”。
已经淘汰的 Java 技术  
已经淘汰的 Java 技术，不要再学了！这篇⽂章提到了在 Java 开发领域中已经被淘汰的技术，⼀定
⼀定⼀定不要再学了！谁推荐你学下⾯这些技术，直接甩他两⽿光⼦。
JSP
原因：JSP 已经过时，⽆法满⾜现代 Web 开发需求；前后端分离成为主流。
替代⽅案：模板引擎（如 Thymeleaf、Freemarker）在传统全栈开发中更流⾏；⽽在前后端分
离架构中，React、Vue、Angular 等现代前端框架已取代 JSP 的⻆⾊。
注意：⼀些国企和央企的⽼项⽬可能仍然在使⽤ JSP，但这种情况越来越少⻅。

学了！谁推荐你学下⾯这些技术，直接甩他两⽿光⼦。
JSP
原因：JSP 已经过时，⽆法满⾜现代 Web 开发需求；前后端分离成为主流。
替代⽅案：模板引擎（如 Thymeleaf、Freemarker）在传统全栈开发中更流⾏；⽽在前后端分
离架构中，React、Vue、Angular 等现代前端框架已取代 JSP 的⻆⾊。
注意：⼀些国企和央企的⽼项⽬可能仍然在使⽤ JSP，但这种情况越来越少⻅。Struts（尤其是 1.x）
原因：配置繁琐、开发效率低，且存在严重的安全漏洞（如世界著名的 Apache Struts 2 漏
洞）。此外，社区维护不⾜，⽣态逐渐萎缩。
替代⽅案：Spring MVC 和 Spring WebFlux 提供了更简洁的开发体验、更强⼤的功能以及完善
的社区⽀持，完全取代了 Struts。
EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)
原因：EJB 过于复杂，开发成本⾼，学习曲线陡峭，在实际项⽬中逐步被更轻量化的框架取
代。
替代⽅案：Spring/Spring Boot 提供了更加简洁且功能强⼤的企业级开发解决⽅案，⼏乎已经
成为 Java 企业开发的事实标准。此外，国产的 Solon 和云原⽣友好的 Quarkus 等框架也⾮常
不错。
Java Applets
原因：现代浏览器（如 Chrome、Firefox、Edge）早已全⾯移除对 Java Applets 的⽀持，同时 
Applets 存在严重的安全性问题。
替代⽅案：HTML5、WebAssembly 以及现代 JavaScript 框架（如 React、Vue）可以实现更
加安全、⾼效的交互体验，⽆需插件⽀持。
SOAP / JAX-WS
原因：SOAP 和 JAX-WS 过于复杂，数据格式冗⻓（XML），对开发效率和性能不友好。
替代⽅案：RESTful API 和 RPC 更轻量、⾼效，是现代微服务架构的⾸选。
RMI（Remote Method Invocation）
原因：RMI 是⼀种早期的 Java 远程调⽤技术，但兼容性差、配置繁琐，且性能较差。
替代⽅案：RESTful API 和 PRC 提供了更简单、⾼效的远程调⽤解决⽅案，完全取代了 
RMI。
Swing / JavaFX
原因：桌⾯应⽤在开发领域的份额⼤幅减少，Web 和移动端成为主流。Swing 和 JavaFX 的⽣
态不如现代跨平台框架丰富。
替代⽅案：跨平台桌⾯开发框架（如 Flutter Desktop、Electron）更具现代化体验。

容性差、配置繁琐，且性能较差。
替代⽅案：RESTful API 和 PRC 提供了更简单、⾼效的远程调⽤解决⽅案，完全取代了 
RMI。
Swing / JavaFX
原因：桌⾯应⽤在开发领域的份额⼤幅减少，Web 和移动端成为主流。Swing 和 JavaFX 的⽣
态不如现代跨平台框架丰富。
替代⽅案：跨平台桌⾯开发框架（如 Flutter Desktop、Electron）更具现代化体验。注意：⼀些国企和央企的⽼项⽬可能仍然在使⽤ Swing / JavaFX，但这种情况越来越少⻅。
Ant
原因：Ant 是⼀种基于 XML 配置的构建⼯具，缺乏易⽤性，配置繁琐。
替代⽅案：Maven 和 Gradle 提供了更⾼效的项⽬依赖管理和构建功能，成为现代构建⼯具的
⾸选。
⾯试题⾃测  
纸上学来终觉浅，躬⾏此事要知难。为了帮助你更好地将知识内化，我特别准备了⼀份与该学习路
线完全匹配的⾼频⾯试题集：https://t.zsxq.com/0eM78gbAr （JavaGuide 知识星球专属）。
这份资源可以帮你：
⾃我检测： 系统性地检验⾃⼰对各个知识点的掌握情况。
查漏补缺： 及时发现⾃⼰的薄弱环节，进⾏针对性巩固。
模拟⾯试： 提前熟悉⾯试节奏和⾼频考点。
强烈推荐⼤家通过⾃测的⽅式，把学习推向更深的层次。
Java 核⼼

ava 基础教程系
列》和韩顺平⽼师的《零基础 30 天学会 Java》就很不错。!
我整理了尚硅⾕最新的 Java 后端学习系列完整的视频教程&资料，喜欢看视频的朋友可以点此
链接下载： 【最新整理】尚硅⾕ Java 后端全套教程 & 实战项⽬（推荐）。
看视频的同时，配套⼀本好书也是⾮常有作⽤的。
优秀的 Java 基础书籍⾮常多，我这⾥只推荐 3 本。
1、《Head First Java》《Head First Java》这本书的内容很轻松有趣，可以说是我学习编程初期最喜欢的⼏本书之⼀了。
同时，这本书也是我的 Java 启蒙书籍。我在学习 Java 的初期多亏了这本书的帮助，⾃⼰才算是跨
进 Java 语⾔的⼤⻔。我在 Java 这块能够坚持下来，这本书有很⼤的功劳。我身边的的很多朋友学
习 Java 初期都是看的这本书。
有很多⼩伙伴就会问了：这本书适不适合编程新⼿阅读呢？
我个⼈觉得这本书还是挺适合编程新⼿阅读的，毕竟是 “Head First” 系列。
2、《Java 核⼼技术卷 1+卷 2》
《Java 核⼼技术卷 1+卷 2》这两本书的内容很多，全看的话⽐较费时间，⽐较适合当⼯作书。我
当时在⼤学的时候就买了两本放在寝室，没事的时候就翻翻。个⼈建议有点 Java 基础之后再读这
两本，介绍的还是⽐较深⼊和全⾯的。
3、《Java 编程的逻辑》

编程新⼿阅读呢？
我个⼈觉得这本书还是挺适合编程新⼿阅读的，毕竟是 “Head First” 系列。
2、《Java 核⼼技术卷 1+卷 2》
《Java 核⼼技术卷 1+卷 2》这两本书的内容很多，全看的话⽐较费时间，⽐较适合当⼯作书。我
当时在⼤学的时候就买了两本放在寝室，没事的时候就翻翻。个⼈建议有点 Java 基础之后再读这
两本，介绍的还是⽐较深⼊和全⾯的。
3、《Java 编程的逻辑》《Java 编程的逻辑》是⼀本⾮常低调的好书，相⽐于⼊⻔书来说，内容更有深度。适合初学者，同
时也适合⼤家拿来复习 Java 基础知识。这篇⽂章中有这本书的阅读建议：⼋股⽂骚套路之 Java 基
础 。
学完 Java 基础之后，你可以⽤⾃⼰学的东⻄实现⼀个简单的 Java 程序，也可以尝试⽤ Java 解决
⼀些编程问题，以此来将⾃⼰学到的东⻄付诸于实践。
不太建议学习 Java 基础的之后通过做游戏来巩固。为什么培训班喜欢通过这种⽅式呢？说⽩点就
是为了找到你的 G 点。新⼿学习完 Java 基础后做游戏⼀般是不太现实的，还不如找⼀些简单的程
序问题解决⼀下⽐如简单的算法题。
记得多总结！打好基础！把⾃⼰重要的东⻄都记录下来。 API ⽂档放在⾃⼰可以看到的地⽅，以备
⾃⼰可以随时查阅。为了能让⾃⼰写出更优秀的代码，《Effective Java》、《重构》 这两本书没事
也可以看。
学完这部分内容之后，务必确保⾃⼰掌握下⾯知识点：
基本语法、基本数据类型
对象、类、接⼝
继承、泛型
⽅法
异常、断⾔
集合
……
学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点（顺便还能准备⼀下⾯试常⻅问
题）：

⻄都记录下来。 API ⽂档放在⾃⼰可以看到的地⽅，以备
⾃⼰可以随时查阅。为了能让⾃⼰写出更优秀的代码，《Effective Java》、《重构》 这两本书没事
也可以看。
学完这部分内容之后，务必确保⾃⼰掌握下⾯知识点：
基本语法、基本数据类型
对象、类、接⼝
继承、泛型
⽅法
异常、断⾔
集合
……
学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点（顺便还能准备⼀下⾯试常⻅问
题）：Java 基础：
Java 基础常⻅⾯试题总结(上)（Java 语⾔的基本概念、语法、数据类型、变量、⽅法等）
Java 基础常⻅⾯试题总结(中)（⾯向对象基础、字符串、对象的⽐较与拷⻉等）
Java 基础常⻅⾯试题总结（下）（异常、泛型、反射、SPI、序列化、注解等）
Java 集合：
Java 集合常⻅⾯试题总结（上）（Java 集合基础、 ArrayList 、 LinkedList 、 HashSet 、
ArrayDeque 、 PriorityQueue 、 BlockingQueue  等）
Java 集合常⻅⾯试题总结（下）（ HashMap 、 ConcurrentHashMap  等）
Java 并发（进阶）  
并发或者说多线程这部分内容稍微会⽐较难以理解和实践。如果你刚学完 Java 基础的话，我建议
你学习并发这部分内容的时候，可以先简单地了解⼀下基础知识⽐如线程和进程的对⽐。到了后
⾯，你对于 Java 了解的更深了之后，再回来仔细看看这部分的内容。
Java 并发书籍的话，挺多写的还不错的，⽐如《实战 Java ⾼并发程序设计》、《Java 并发编程之
美》、《Java 并发实现原理：JDK 源码剖析》。

说多线程这部分内容稍微会⽐较难以理解和实践。如果你刚学完 Java 基础的话，我建议
你学习并发这部分内容的时候，可以先简单地了解⼀下基础知识⽐如线程和进程的对⽐。到了后
⾯，你对于 Java 了解的更深了之后，再回来仔细看看这部分的内容。
Java 并发书籍的话，挺多写的还不错的，⽐如《实战 Java ⾼并发程序设计》、《Java 并发编程之
美》、《Java 并发实现原理：JDK 源码剖析》。想要系统学习的话，还是找从⾥⾯找⼀本认真阅读⼀下。当然，你也可以多选⼏本结合起来⼀起
看，遇到不懂的知识点再去看看别的书籍的讲解或者找对应的博客讲解。
视频的话，还是推荐尚硅⾕周阳⽼师讲的：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ar4y1x727/ 。
!
我整理了尚硅⾕最新的 Java 后端学习系列完整的视频教程&资料，喜欢看视频的朋友可以点此

学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（上）（多线程基础知识，例如线程和进程的概念、死锁）
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（中）（各种锁，例如乐观锁和悲观锁、 synchronized 关键字、
ReentrantLock ）
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（下）( ThreadLocal 、线程池、 Future 、AQS、虚拟线程等)

实战项⽬（推荐）。
学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（上）（多线程基础知识，例如线程和进程的概念、死锁）
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（中）（各种锁，例如乐观锁和悲观锁、 synchronized 关键字、
ReentrantLock ）
Java并发常⻅⾯试题总结（下）( ThreadLocal 、线程池、 Future 、AQS、虚拟线程等)JVM（进阶）  
JVM 属于是⽐并发更⾼阶⼀些的内容，学习顺序可以适当延后，⽐如你可以在框架知识学完之后再
回过头来看 JVM。并且，JVM 相关的知识点，⼀般是⼤⼚（例如美团、阿⾥）和⼀些不错的中⼚
（例如携程、顺丰、招银⽹络）⾯试才会问到，⾯试国企、差⼀点的中⼚和⼩⼚就没必要准备了。
不过，我个⼈建议如果你学有余⼒的话，还是抽时间学习⼀下，还是有⽤的。正所谓只有搞懂了 
JVM 才有可能真正把 Java 语⾔“吃透”。
实际⼯作中，中⼩⼚⼀般不会做 JVM 调优，但万⼀遇到类似 OOM 的问题，你如果知道如何去排查
和解决，岂不是更好？
学习 JVM 这部分的内容，⼀定要注意要实战和理论结合。
书籍的话，《深⼊理解 Java 虚拟机》 这本书是⾸先要推荐的。
这本书就⼀句话形容：国产书籍中的战⽃机，实实在在的优秀！ （真⼼希望国内能有更多这样的优
质书籍出现！加油！
"
）
这本书的第三版已经出来挺久了，新增了很多不错的内容⽐如 ZGC 等新⼀代 GC 的原理剖析。
不论是你⾯试还是你想要在 Java 领域学习的更深，你都离不开这本书籍。这本书不光要看，你还
要多看⼏遍，⾥⾯都是⼲货。这本书⾥⾯还有⼀些需要⾃⼰实践的东⻄，我建议你也跟着实践⼀
下。
类似的书籍还有 《实战 Java 虚拟机》、《虚拟机设计与实现:以 JVM 为例》，这两本都是⾮常不
错的！如果你对实战⽐较感兴趣，想要⾃⼰动⼿写⼀个简易的 JVM 的话，可以看看 《⾃⼰动⼿写 Java 虚
拟机》 这本书。
书中的代码是基于 Go 语⾔实现的，搞懂了原理之后，你可以使⽤ Java 语⾔模仿着写⼀个，也算
是练练⼿！ 如果你当前没有能⼒独⽴使⽤ Java 语⾔模仿着写⼀个的话，你也可以在⽹上找到很多
基于 Java 语⾔版本的实现，⽐如《zachaxy 的⼿写 JVM 系列》 。

错的！如果你对实战⽐较感兴趣，想要⾃⼰动⼿写⼀个简易的 JVM 的话，可以看看 《⾃⼰动⼿写 Java 虚
拟机》 这本书。
书中的代码是基于 Go 语⾔实现的，搞懂了原理之后，你可以使⽤ Java 语⾔模仿着写⼀个，也算
是练练⼿！ 如果你当前没有能⼒独⽴使⽤ Java 语⾔模仿着写⼀个的话，你也可以在⽹上找到很多
基于 Java 语⾔版本的实现，⽐如《zachaxy 的⼿写 JVM 系列》 。另外，R ⼤在⾖瓣发的《从表到⾥学习 JVM 实现》这篇⽂章中也推荐了很多不错的 JVM 相关的书
籍，推荐⼩伙伴们去看看。
视频的话，尚硅⾕的宋红康⽼师讲的《JVM 全套教程》内容⾮常硬，⼀共有接近 400 ⼩节（对应的
浓缩精华版：《尚硅⾕ JVM 精讲与 GC 调优教程》）。
课程的内容分为 3 部分：
1. 《内存与垃圾回收篇》
2. 《字节码与类的加载篇》
3. 《性能监控与调优篇》
!
我整理了尚硅⾕最新的 Java 后端学习系列完整的视频教程&资料，喜欢看视频的朋友可以点此
链接下载： 【最新整理】尚硅⾕ Java 后端全套教程 & 实战项⽬（推荐）。学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
Java 内存区域详解（重点）
JVM 垃圾回收详解（重点）
类⽂件结构详解
类加载过程详解
类加载器详解（重点）
数据库  
基础（可选）  
数据库基础知识点的话，其实是可选择性学习的。对于计算机专业的同学来说，⼤学的时候应该也
学习过。不过，绝⼤部分学了之后也相当于没学，没学过的也不⽤担⼼哈！
这⾥还是提供⼀些学习资料给想要学习数据库基础知识的同学把！
书籍的话，强烈推荐《数据库系统概念》，这本书涵盖了数据库系统的全套概念，知识体系清晰，
是学习数据库系统⾮常经典的教材！不是参考书！如果你觉得书籍⽐较枯燥，⾃⼰坚持不下来的话，我推荐你可以先看看⼀些不错的视频。就⽐如北
京师范⼤学的《数据库系统原理》这个就很不错。
这个课程的⽼师讲的⾮常详细，⽽且每⼀⼩节的作业设计的也与所讲知识很贴合，后⾯还有很多配
套实验。
如果你⽐较喜欢动⼿，对于理论知识⽐较抵触的话，我推荐你看看《如何开发⼀个简单的数据库》 
，这个 project 会⼿把⼿教你编写⼀个简单的数据库。

的教材！不是参考书！如果你觉得书籍⽐较枯燥，⾃⼰坚持不下来的话，我推荐你可以先看看⼀些不错的视频。就⽐如北
京师范⼤学的《数据库系统原理》这个就很不错。
这个课程的⽼师讲的⾮常详细，⽽且每⼀⼩节的作业设计的也与所讲知识很贴合，后⾯还有很多配
套实验。
如果你⽐较喜欢动⼿，对于理论知识⽐较抵触的话，我推荐你看看《如何开发⼀个简单的数据库》 
，这个 project 会⼿把⼿教你编写⼀个简单的数据库。纸上学来终觉浅 绝知此事要躬⾏！强烈推荐 CS 专业的⼩伙伴⼀定要多多实践！！！
MySQL  
对于 Java 开发来说，虽然 PostgreSQL 也挺⽕，但 MySQL 是主流，国内的绝⼤部分企业还是⽤的 
MySQL。
MySQL ⼊⻔可以找⼀些视频看看，⽐如⿊⻢的《MySQL 数据库⼊⻔到精通》。看视频的过程中，
可以配套⼀本 MySQL ⼊⻔类的书籍⽐如《MySQL 必知必会》。
初期不需要学太深了，搞清楚下⾯这些知识点即可：
1. MySQL 常⽤命令 ：
安全：登录、增加/删除⽤户、备份数据和还原数据
数据库操作： 建库建表/删库删表、⽤户权限分配
……
2. MySQL 中常⽤的数据类型、字符集编码
3. MySQL 简单查询、条件查询、模糊查询、多表查询以及如何对查询结果排序、过滤、分
组……
4. MySQL 中使⽤索引、视图、存储过程、游标、触发器5. ……
更进⼀步的话，可以找⼀些优秀的书籍来学习底层原理和性能优化，⽐如《⾼性能 MySQL》和
《MySQL 技术内幕》。
另外，强推⼀波 《MySQL 是怎样运⾏的》 这本书，内容很适合拿来准备⾯试。讲的很细节，但⼜
不枯燥，内容⾮常良⼼！
如果你想让⾃⼰更加了解 MySQL ，同时也是为了准备⾯试的话，下⾯这些知识点要格外注意：
1. 索引：索引优缺点、B 树和 B+树、聚集索引与⾮聚集索引、覆盖索引
2. 事务：事务、数据库事务、ACID、并发事务、事务隔离级别
3. 存储引擎（MyISAM 和 InnoDB）
4. 锁机制与 InnoDB 锁算法

运⾏的》 这本书，内容很适合拿来准备⾯试。讲的很细节，但⼜
不枯燥，内容⾮常良⼼！
如果你想让⾃⼰更加了解 MySQL ，同时也是为了准备⾯试的话，下⾯这些知识点要格外注意：
1. 索引：索引优缺点、B 树和 B+树、聚集索引与⾮聚集索引、覆盖索引
2. 事务：事务、数据库事务、ACID、并发事务、事务隔离级别
3. 存储引擎（MyISAM 和 InnoDB）
4. 锁机制与 InnoDB 锁算法学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
MySQL 常⻅⾯试题总结（MySQL 基础、存储引擎、事务、索引、锁、性能优化等）
MySQL 索引详解
MySQL 三⼤⽇志(binlog、redo log 和 undo log)详解
MySQL 事务隔离级别详解
InnoDB 存储引擎对 MVCC 的实现
SQL 语句在 MySQL 中的执⾏过程
PostgreSQL（可选）  
和 MySQL ⼀样，PostgreSQL 也是开源免费且功能强⼤的关系型数据库。PostgreSQL 的 Slogan 
是“世界上最先进的开源关系型数据库” 。
客观来说，PostgreSQL 确实⽐ MySQL 优秀。不过，⽬前国内 MySQL 还是主流，PostgreSQL 是
可选择性学习的。
PostgreSQL 中⽂⽂档建议看看：http://www.postgres.cn/docs/14/index.html 。另外， PostgreSQL 
书籍的话，看这⾥的推荐即可：https://javaguide.cn/books/database.html#postgresql 。
Redis  
后端项⽬如果⽤到分布式缓存的话，⼀般⽤的都是 Redis。不过，Redis 不仅仅能做缓存，还能⽤
作分布式锁、延时队列、消息队列等等。
免费的视频教程的话，推荐 GeekHour 的 ⼀⼩时Redis教程（⾮常推荐，通俗易懂，简单介绍了 
Redis 中涉及到的绝⼤部分知识点） 和尚硅⾕的 《Redis 7 系列最新视频》（阳哥出品，内容更全
⾯，Redis 版本更新，强烈推荐）。
书籍的话，强烈推荐 《Redis 设计与实现》和 《Redis 核⼼原理与实践》 这两本书。《Redis 核⼼
原理与实践》这本书出版⽇期相对近⼀些，主要是结合源码来分析 Redis 的重要知识点⽐如各种数
据结构和⾼级特性。

荐，通俗易懂，简单介绍了 
Redis 中涉及到的绝⼤部分知识点） 和尚硅⾕的 《Redis 7 系列最新视频》（阳哥出品，内容更全
⾯，Redis 版本更新，强烈推荐）。
书籍的话，强烈推荐 《Redis 设计与实现》和 《Redis 核⼼原理与实践》 这两本书。《Redis 核⼼
原理与实践》这本书出版⽇期相对近⼀些，主要是结合源码来分析 Redis 的重要知识点⽐如各种数
据结构和⾼级特性。付费专栏的话，推荐⼀个极客时间的《Redis 核⼼技术与实战》，虽然未涉及到太多新版 Redis 的
内容，但胜在内容全⾯且清晰易懂。我当时看这个专栏确实学了不少东⻄，尤其是评论区有很多⼤
佬的精彩的评论。
学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
缓存基础常⻅⾯试题总结
Redis 常⻅⾯试题总结（上）
Redis 常⻅⾯试题总结（下）
Redis 5 种基本数据类型详解
Redis 3 种特殊数据类型详解
Redis 持久化机制详解
Redis 内存碎⽚详解

但胜在内容全⾯且清晰易懂。我当时看这个专栏确实学了不少东⻄，尤其是评论区有很多⼤
佬的精彩的评论。
学习的过程中，强烈建议配合上我总结的常⻅问题和重要知识点：
缓存基础常⻅⾯试题总结
Redis 常⻅⾯试题总结（上）
Redis 常⻅⾯试题总结（下）
Redis 5 种基本数据类型详解
Redis 3 种特殊数据类型详解
Redis 持久化机制详解
Redis 内存碎⽚详解
MongoDB（可选）MongoDB 作为 Java 后端开发来说，是可选择性学习的，⽤的不多，⾯试⼀般也不会问，除⾮你的
项⽬⽤到了 MongoDB 。
这⾥就不推荐视频或者书籍了，推荐两篇我写的⽂章：
MongoDB 常⻅⾯试题总结（上）
MongoDB 常⻅⾯试题总结（下）
常⽤开发⼯具  
⾮常重要！⾮常重要！特别是 Git 和 Docker。
除了下⾯这些⼯具之外，我强烈建议你⼀定要搞懂 Github 的使⽤。⼀些使⽤ Github 的⼩技巧，你
可以看Github ⼩技巧这篇⽂章。
IDEA  
俗话说：“⼯欲善其事，必先利其器 !”。选择⼀款好的开发⼯具对于我们⾼效率编码⾮常有帮助！
常⽤的 Java 开发⼯具就 Eclipse 和 IDEA。就我个⼈⽽⾔ IDEA 是最适合 Java 开发者的 IDE ，没
有之⼀（勿杠，你喜欢的就是最好的）。
除了 IDEA ⾃身对编码优秀的⽀持（⽐如智能上下⽂提示）之外，IDEA 中还有丰富的插件来帮助我
们⾼效开发。
近⼏年，像 Cursor 这样的 AI 编程 IDE 兴起，确实对 IDEA 有了⼀定冲击。但整体来看，IDEA 依
然难以被取代。⽆论是开发体验还是代码重构能⼒，IDEA 都有着⽆与伦⽐的优势。当然，在 AI 辅
助编程这⼀块，IDEA 的表现的确有些落后。要知道，过去代码智能提示可是它的拿⼿好戏。
IntelliJ IDEA 官⽅中⽂⽂档今年正式上线了，强烈推荐以这个为第⼀⼿资料。
IDEA 官⽅中⽂⽂档⼊⼝： https://www.jetbrains.com/zh-cn/help/idea/getting-started.html
另外，「IDEA ⾼效使⽤指南」是我创建的⼀个⽹站，上⾯包含了下⾯这些内容：

是它的拿⼿好戏。
IntelliJ IDEA 官⽅中⽂⽂档今年正式上线了，强烈推荐以这个为第⼀⼿资料。
IDEA 官⽅中⽂⽂档⼊⼝： https://www.jetbrains.com/zh-cn/help/idea/getting-started.html
另外，「IDEA ⾼效使⽤指南」是我创建的⼀个⽹站，上⾯包含了下⾯这些内容：
IDEA 使⽤技巧
IDEA 必备插件
IDEA 插件开发⼊⻔使⽤ IDEA 进⾏重构的⼩技巧
使⽤ IDEA 进⾏源码阅读的技巧
Maven  
Maven 其实使⽤起来挺简单的，⼀两天时间就能⼊⻔基本使⽤了。不过，想要⽤好还是挺难的，初
期的时候会基本使⽤就好了。
多提⼀句：学习常⽤框架之前可以提前花时间学习⼀下 Maven 的使⽤，千万不要 到处找 Jar 包，
下载 Jar 包（如果你做的项⽬没⽤上包管理⼯具，那请你尽快换⼀个新点的教程看）。
Maven 这⾥不⽤推荐什么视频或者书籍了，直接看下⾯这篇⽂章即可：
Maven 核⼼概念总结
Maven 最佳实践
四⼗五图，⼀万五千字！⼀⽂让你⾛出迷雾玩转 Maven！
学完之后，务必要搞懂下⾯这些问题（初学者搞懂前两个问题即可）：
1. Maven 项⽬如何创建？如何引⼊依赖？2. Maven 依赖冲突如何解决？
3. Maven 多模块项⽬的构建、运⾏、打包如何做？
4. Maven 私服如何搭建？
Git  
Git 技能对于程序员来说也是必备的！试着在学习的过程中将⾃⼰的代码托管在 Github 上，有⼀个
漂亮的 Github 主⻚在求职⾯试中是⼗分加分的。并且，现在的企业都是基于 Git 在 GitHub 或 
GitLab 平台上做版本控制。
学习 Git 的话，强烈推荐给⼤家⼀个可以交互式学习 Git 的⽹站 Learn Git Branching。效果真的⾮
常⾮常棒，通过游戏的⽅式让你学习 Git 的常⻅操作。
整个教程分为很多关，每⼀关都有⾮常详细的指导，还会有详细的动图展示结果。并且，你做错了
之后还可以使⽤ reset  命令从头开始。如果你是在不知道答案的话，还可以使⽤ show solution  命令查看答案。

关概念、Git 常⻅操作这篇⽂章都有介
绍到。
如果想要详细了解 Git 的话，可以看看《Pro Git》这本书，介绍的⾮常全⾯，免费，⽀持阅读，并
且有中⽂版！这是这本书的另外⼀个在线阅读地址：https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2。
如果你⽐较喜欢看视频教程的话，可以看看极客时间的《玩转 Git 三剑客》，课程的作者是携程代
码平台负责⼈苏玲，讲的挺不错的！
Docker传统的开发流程中，我们的项⽬通常需要使⽤ MySQL、Redis、FastDFS 等等环境，这些环境都是
需要我们⼿动去进⾏下载并配置的，安装配置流程极其复杂，⽽且不同系统下的操作也不⼀样。
Docker 的出现完美地解决了这⼀问题，我们可以在容器中安装 MySQL、Redis 等软件环境，使得
应⽤和环境架构分开，它的优势在于：
1. ⼀致的运⾏环境，能够更轻松地迁移
2. 对进程进⾏封装隔离，容器与容器之间互不影响，更⾼效地利⽤系统资源
3. 可以通过镜像复制多个⼀致的容器
Docker 常⻅概念解读，可以看这篇 JavaGuide 的这篇Docker 基本概念解读 ，从零到上⼿实战可以
看Docker 从⼊⻔到上⼿⼲事这篇⽂章，内容⾮常详细！
另外，再给⼤家推荐⼀本质量⾮常⾼的开源书籍《Docker 从⼊⻔到实践》 ，这本书的内容⾮常
新，毕竟书籍的内容是开源的，可以随时改进。
如果想看视频的话，推荐这个：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11L411g7U1/ ，没啥废话，⼲货挺
多。⽽且，课件也是直接免费分享出来的：https://docker.easydoc.net/doc/81170005/cCewZWoN/l

开源书籍《Docker 从⼊⻔到实践》 ，这本书的内容⾮常
新，毕竟书籍的内容是开源的，可以随时改进。
如果想看视频的话，推荐这个：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11L411g7U1/ ，没啥废话，⼲货挺
多。⽽且，课件也是直接免费分享出来的：https://docker.easydoc.net/doc/81170005/cCewZWoN/l
TKfePfP 。最后，在学习完 Docker 的常⻅操作之后，建议⼤家以⼀个前后端分离的项⽬为例，去实践部署⼀
下。⽐如，你可以选择部署⾃⼰的简历项⽬，这样的话，项⽬经历部分贴上在线体验地址，也算是
⼀个加分项了！
设计模式  
软件开发中有⼀个概念叫做“软件复⽤”。简单来说，软件复⽤就是我们在构建⼀个新的软件的时
候，不需要从零开始，通过复⽤已有的⼀些轮⼦（框架、第三⽅库等）、设计模式、设计原则等等
现成的物料，我们可以更快地构建出⼀个满⾜要求的软件。
软件复⽤需要设计模式的帮助。因为，在软件开发中，设计模式可以通过封装变化来提⾼代码的可
扩展性和可维护性！
在我们平时⼯作的业务开发中，如果你不会设计模式，你或许也可以完成项⽬的功能需求。但是！
单纯 CRUD 多没意思啊！我们要思考如何写出质量更⾼的业务代码。另外，各种框架⽐如 
Spring、MyBatis 中都⼤量使⽤了设计模式。如果，你想要搞懂他们的原理，设计模式也是你的必
备利器。
设计模式不光需要我们在学习，最重要的还是要不断去实践体会。但是！设计模式不是银弹，不要
为了⽤设计模式⽽⽤设计模式。想要看书学习设计模式的话，⾸推 《重学 Java 设计模式》 。有趣的例⼦，配合形象的图⽚，通过
实战案例讲解设计模式的⽅式秒极了！⽂中的每⼀个细节⽆不透露着作者的⽤⼼！每⼀种设计模式
实际都不难理解，⼤部分读者最需要的还是设计模式的实战经验。如果你能细⼼思考实践《重学 
Java 设计模式》 中的每⼀个案例，我相信，你对设计模式的理解⼀定会更上⼀层楼！
想要看视频学习的话，⾸推 《尚硅⾕ Java 设计模式（图解+框架源码剖析）》 这个视频。
这个视频通过图解+框架源码分析的⽅式全⾯地讲解了设计模式相关的内容，包括设计模式七⼤原
则、UML 类图-类的六⼤关系、23 种设计模式及其分类等知识点。

部分读者最需要的还是设计模式的实战经验。如果你能细⼼思考实践《重学 
Java 设计模式》 中的每⼀个案例，我相信，你对设计模式的理解⼀定会更上⼀层楼！
想要看视频学习的话，⾸推 《尚硅⾕ Java 设计模式（图解+框架源码剖析）》 这个视频。
这个视频通过图解+框架源码分析的⽅式全⾯地讲解了设计模式相关的内容，包括设计模式七⼤原
则、UML 类图-类的六⼤关系、23 种设计模式及其分类等知识点。Linux  
对于 Java 程序员来说， 我们需要掌握 Linux 基本的使⽤，尤其是是各种常⽤的命令⽐如：⽬录切
换命令、⽬录操作命令、⽂件的操作命令、压缩或者解压⽂件的命令等等。像 Linux 内核架构、底
层原理这些底层内容，不是必需的，可以根据⾃身情况来决定是否学习。
对于想要快速⼊⻔ Linux 的同学来说，建议阅读我写的 Linux 基础知识总结这篇⽂章，⾥⾯介绍了 
Java 程序员必知的 Linux 的⼀些概念以及常⻅命令。
视频的话，我推荐 GeekHour 的 30 分钟 Linux ⼊⻔教程，通俗易懂，实战讲解！不过，相对偏基
础⼀些，适合想要快速⼊⻔的同学。
对于想要系统学习的同学来说，还是建议看书籍，像《⻦哥的 Linux 私房菜》系列就挺不错的。不
过，内容有点太多了，个⼈还是更建议作为⼯具书参考或者选择⾃⼰感兴趣的内容章节进⾏学习。
不要忘记学习⼀下 Shell 编程了，这个也是必须要掌握的，快速⼊⻔可以阅读我写的 Shell 编程基
础知识总结这篇⽂章，总结了 Shell 变量、基本运算符、流程控制、函数这些重要的知识点。
前端基础  
笔者主要从事 Java 后端开发的，对于前端的了解属于⽪⽑，刚刚⼊⻔的状态（当过⼀年全栈），
这⾥只是简单聊聊⾃⼰的看法。
前端框架更新换代的很快，⽬前⽐较流⾏的是 Vue 和 React 。对于国内的同学，Vue 更适合投⼊精
⼒学习，因为国内⽤ Vue 的公司更多⼀些。不过，前端框架并不是必学的，可以根据⾃身情况来决
定是否学习。

量、基本运算符、流程控制、函数这些重要的知识点。
前端基础  
笔者主要从事 Java 后端开发的，对于前端的了解属于⽪⽑，刚刚⼊⻔的状态（当过⼀年全栈），
这⾥只是简单聊聊⾃⼰的看法。
前端框架更新换代的很快，⽬前⽐较流⾏的是 Vue 和 React 。对于国内的同学，Vue 更适合投⼊精
⼒学习，因为国内⽤ Vue 的公司更多⼀些。不过，前端框架并不是必学的，可以根据⾃身情况来决
定是否学习。不过，不管前端这些技术怎么变，前端三剑客（HTML、CSS、JavaScript ）是不会变的，也是必
学的。
HTML 和 CSS 相对 JS 来说就⽐较简单了。你可以在 W3school 上学习⼀些关于 HTML、CSS、JS 
的基础知识。然后，通过⼀个简单的前端项⽬来实战⼀下。⽐如你可以做⼀个个⼈简历或者模仿某
某官⽹写个类似的⽹⻚。
JavaScript 的⽔更深，也是前端⾯试中的重⼼。
学习 JS 的话，MDN 上的 JS 相关的内容是必须要看的！上⾯的内容很全⾯，质量⾮常⾼！
除此之外，开源的 JS 教程《The Modern JavaScript Tutorial》⾮常赞！⽬前的话，这个系列的教
程还被翻译成了多国的语⾔。这个教程的内容分为 3 部分
1. JavaScript 编程语⾔ ： JavaScript ⼊⻔，还会介绍 OOP 等相关⾼级概念。
2. 浏览器（⽂档，事件，接⼝） ： 学习如何管理浏览器⻚⾯
3. 其他⽂章 ： 按需学习其他 JavaScript ⾼级知识。
另外，除了⼀些⽼项⽬之外，现在⼀般都是前后端分离开发，也就是前端和后端可以独⽴开发、测
试和部署，两者之间通过 API 进⾏通信。因此，后端程序员还需要掌握：
HTTP 协议（计算机⽹络部分的内容，这⾥再多提⼀下）
RESTful API 的设计和使⽤

2. 浏览器（⽂档，事件，接⼝） ： 学习如何管理浏览器⻚⾯
3. 其他⽂章 ： 按需学习其他 JavaScript ⾼级知识。
另外，除了⼀些⽼项⽬之外，现在⼀般都是前后端分离开发，也就是前端和后端可以独⽴开发、测
试和部署，两者之间通过 API 进⾏通信。因此，后端程序员还需要掌握：
HTTP 协议（计算机⽹络部分的内容，这⾥再多提⼀下）
RESTful API 的设计和使⽤前后端通信的常⻅⽅式：⽐如 Ajax（短连接）、WebSocket（⻓连接，双向的）
J2EE 基础  
Servlet  
Servlet  属于⽐较古⽼的技术了，现在你⼏乎不会直接使⽤到 Servlet  相关的 API。不过，学习 
Servlet  有助于我们搞清各种封装的⽐较好的 Web 框架的原理，⽐如 Spring MVC  不过就是对 
Servlet  的封装，它的底层还是依赖于 Servlet 。
在 Java Web 程序中， Servlet  主要负责接收⽤户请求 HttpServletRequest ,在 doGet() , doPost() 中
做相应的处理，并将回应 HttpServletResponse 反馈给⽤户。
你可以通过书籍《Head First Servlets & JSP（中⽂版）》或者《Servlet 和 JSP 学习指南》来学习 
Servlet 基础知识。
注意：JSP 就不要学了，过时的技术，已经被淘汰了！
Web 服务器  
Tomcat 是 Apache 基⾦会下的⼀个项⽬，主要⽤作 Web 服务器。
如果你直接学习 Spring Boot 的话，不学习 Tomcat 也没什么影响（建议还是学⼀学）。因为 
Spring Boot （ spring-boot-starter-web ）使⽤ Tomcat 作为默认的嵌⼊式 Servlet  容器, 你使⽤起来是
⽆感知的。
简单来说，Tomcat 主要实现了 2 个核⼼功能：
1. 处理 Socket  连接，负责⽹络字节流与 Request  和 Response  对象的转化。
2. 加载和管理 Servlet ，以及具体处理 Request  请求。
如果你要深⼊研究 Tomcat 的话，⾸选极客时间的 《深⼊拆解 Tomcat & Jetty》 这个专栏。这是我
看过讲解 Tomcat 底层原理最好的资料，强烈推荐！
这个专栏不光可以加深⾃⼰对于 Tomcat 的理解，还能提⾼⾃⼰对于系统架构、性能优化等领域的
思考。

uest  和 Response  对象的转化。
2. 加载和管理 Servlet ，以及具体处理 Request  请求。
如果你要深⼊研究 Tomcat 的话，⾸选极客时间的 《深⼊拆解 Tomcat & Jetty》 这个专栏。这是我
看过讲解 Tomcat 底层原理最好的资料，强烈推荐！
这个专栏不光可以加深⾃⼰对于 Tomcat 的理解，还能提⾼⾃⼰对于系统架构、性能优化等领域的
思考。除了 Tomcat 之外，Nginx 也是必须要学习的！
Nginx 是⼀个⾼性能的 HTTP 和反向代理服务服务器，经常被拿来做反向代理和负载均衡。
如果你要学习 Nginx 的话，可以看看《Nginx 核⼼知识 150 讲》 。内容很全⾯，从概念、代码再到
实战，从 HTTP 到 OpenResty 。
常⽤框架  
实际⾯试中，框架类知识问的不多，学习常⽤框架更多地是为了满⾜项⽬开发需要以及⼯作要求。
Spring/SpringBoot  
没有学习 Spring 可以直接上⼿学习 SpringBoot 吗？

常被拿来做反向代理和负载均衡。
如果你要学习 Nginx 的话，可以看看《Nginx 核⼼知识 150 讲》 。内容很全⾯，从概念、代码再到
实战，从 HTTP 到 OpenResty 。
常⽤框架  
实际⾯试中，框架类知识问的不多，学习常⽤框架更多地是为了满⾜项⽬开发需要以及⼯作要求。
Spring/SpringBoot  
没有学习 Spring 可以直接上⼿学习 SpringBoot 吗？明确的说，必须可以！⽬前绝⼤部分企业都是⽤的 SpringBoot ，Spring 也并不是学习 Spring Boot 
的前置基础，相⽐于 Spring 来说，Spring Boot 要更容易上⼿⼀些！如果你只是想使⽤ Spring Boot 
来做项⽬的话，直接学 Spring Boot 就可以了。
不过，个⼈还是建议提前搞懂 Spring AOP 和 IoC 这俩⽐较重要的概念之后再去学习 SpringBoot。
除此之外，准备⾯试的话，Spring 中 bean 的作⽤域与⽣命周期、SpringMVC ⼯作原理详解等等知
识点都是⾮常重要的，⼀定要搞懂。推荐阅读这篇⽂章：Spring 常⻅⾯试题总结。
学习 Spring Boot 的话，还是建议可以多看看 《Spring Boot 的官⽅⽂档》，写的很详细。
像 SpringBoot 和⼀些常⻅技术的整合你也要知道怎么做，⽐如 SpringBoot 整合 MyBatis、 
ElasticSearch、SpringSecurity、Redis 等等。尽量还是实践⼀下，写⼀些 Demo。到了后期，甚⾄
可以独⽴做⼀些⼩项⽬把这些知识都应⽤上。
书籍的话，个⼈其实并没有什么特别好的推荐，毕竟是框架类知识，更新换代的⽐较快，很多书籍
的内容都已经过时了。
考虑到很多同学⽐较喜欢阅读书籍，我这⾥还是简单推荐⼏本吧！
对于想要实战的同学，我强烈不推荐看书，直接看尚硅⾕的实战项⽬即可。这篇⽂章可以获取到最
新的视频且对尚硅⾕的实战项⽬做了介绍：【最新整理】尚硅⾕ Java 后端全套教程 & 实战项⽬
（推荐）。
对于专研 Spring Boot 底层原理同学，可以看看 《Spring Boot 编程思想（核⼼篇）》 。

快，很多书籍
的内容都已经过时了。
考虑到很多同学⽐较喜欢阅读书籍，我这⾥还是简单推荐⼏本吧！
对于想要实战的同学，我强烈不推荐看书，直接看尚硅⾕的实战项⽬即可。这篇⽂章可以获取到最
新的视频且对尚硅⾕的实战项⽬做了介绍：【最新整理】尚硅⾕ Java 后端全套教程 & 实战项⽬
（推荐）。
对于专研 Spring Boot 底层原理同学，可以看看 《Spring Boot 编程思想（核⼼篇）》 。这本书稍微有点啰嗦，不过，原理介绍的⽐较清楚（不适合初学者）。
如果你⽐较喜欢看视频的话，推荐尚硅⾕雷神的《2023 版 Spring Boot3 零基础⼊⻔》 。这可能
是全⽹质量最⾼并且免费的 Spring Boot 教程了，好评爆炸！
另外，Spring Boot 这块还有很多优质的开源教程，我已经整理好放到 Java 优质开源技术教程 中
了。
MyBatis  
MyBatis 是国内使⽤最多的 ORM 框架。在学习 Spring/Spring Boot 的时候，你就要顺带去学习 
MyBatis，这个我在上⾯也提到过。
另外，建议你还要掌握⾄少⼀个 MyBatis 增强框架，这⾥推荐两个国产的：
1. MyBatis-Plus：简称 MP，在 MyBatis 的基础上只做增强不做改变，为简化开发、提⾼效率⽽
⽣。
2. MyBatis-Flex：⾮常轻量、同时拥有极⾼的性能与灵活性的  MyBatis 增强框架。
对于做项⽬的同学，也可以直接选择学习使⽤  MyBatis 增强框架。

另外，建议你还要掌握⾄少⼀个 MyBatis 增强框架，这⾥推荐两个国产的：
1. MyBatis-Plus：简称 MP，在 MyBatis 的基础上只做增强不做改变，为简化开发、提⾼效率⽽
⽣。
2. MyBatis-Flex：⾮常轻量、同时拥有极⾼的性能与灵活性的  MyBatis 增强框架。
对于做项⽬的同学，也可以直接选择学习使⽤  MyBatis 增强框架。单元测试  
对于单测来说，⽬前常⽤的单测框架有：JUnit、Mockito、Spock、PowerMock、JMockit、
TestableMock 等等。
JUnit ⼏乎是默认选择，但是其不⽀持 Mock，因此我们还需要选择⼀个 Mock ⼯具。Mockito 和 
Spock 是最主流的两款 Mock ⼯具，⼀般都是在这两者中选择。
究竟是选择 Mockito 还是 Spock 呢？我这⾥做了⼀些简单的对⽐分析：
1. Spock 没办法 Mock 静态⽅法和私有⽅法 ，Mockito 3.4.0 以后，⽀持静态⽅法的 Mock，具体
可以看这个 issue：https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1013，具体教程可以看这篇⽂
章：https://www.baeldung.com/mockito-mock-static-methods。
2. Spock 基于 Groovy，写出来的测试代码更清晰易读，⽐较规范(⾃带 given-when-then 的常⽤
测试结构规范)。Mockito 没有具体的结构规范，需要项⽬组⾃⼰约定⼀个或者遵守⽐较好的测
试代码实践。通常来说，同样的测试⽤例，Spock 的代码要更简洁。
3. Mockito 使⽤的⼈群更⼴泛，稳定可靠。并且，Mockito 是 SpringBoot Test 默认集成的 Mock 
⼯具。
Mockito 和 Spock 都是⾮常不错的 Mock ⼯具，相对来说，Mockito 的适⽤性更强⼀些。
这⾥顺带推荐⼀些测试相关的学习资料：
1. 阿⾥内部单元测试培训教程
2. 单元测试到底是什么？应该怎么做？
3. Integration Testing in Spring
4. Testing the Web Layer
5. 可能是全⽹最好的 Spock 单测⼊⻔⽂章:
6. 单元测试框架 Mockito 落地实践分享
7. 如何写出有效的单元测试
Netty（可选）  
Netty 是 Java ⽹络编程最热⻔的框架，⼤家可以根据个⼈需要决定是否进⾏学习，实际企业开发中
⽤的不多。

Netty（可选）  
Netty 是 Java ⽹络编程最热⻔的框架，⼤家可以根据个⼈需要决定是否进⾏学习，实际企业开发中
⽤的不多。不过，个⼈建议学有余⼒的同学还是抽时间认真学习⼀下，对个⼈开发能⼒的提升还是很有帮助
的。
1. Netty 基于 NIO （NIO 是⼀种同步⾮阻塞的 I/O 模型，在 Java 1.4 中引⼊了 NIO ）。使⽤ 
Netty 可以极⼤地简化并简化了 TCP 和 UDP 套接字服务器等⽹络编程,并且性能以及安全性等
很多⽅⾯都⾮常优秀。
2. 我们平常经常接触的 Dubbo、RocketMQ、Elasticsearch、gRPC、Spark、Elasticsearch 等等
热⻔开源项⽬都⽤到了 Netty。
3. ⼤部分微服务框架底层涉及到⽹络通信的部分都是基于 Netty 来做的，⽐如说 Spring Cloud ⽣
态系统中的⽹关 Spring Cloud Gateway 。
下⾯是⼀些⽐较推荐的书籍/专栏。
《Netty 实战》
这本书可以⽤来⼊⻔ Netty ，内容从 BIO 聊到了 NIO、之后才详细介绍为什么有 Netty 、Netty 为
什么好⽤以及 Netty 重要的知识点讲解。
这本书基本把 Netty ⼀些重要的知识点都介绍到了，⽽且基本都是通过实战的形式讲解。
《Netty 进阶之路：跟着案例学 Netty》内容都是关于使⽤ Netty 的实践案例⽐如内存泄露这些东⻄。如果你觉得你的 Netty 已经完全⼊⻔
了，并且你想要对 Netty 掌握的更深的话，推荐你看⼀下这本书。
《跟闪电侠学 Netty：Netty 即时聊天实战与底层原理》
这本书分为上下两篇，上篇通过⼀个即时聊天系统的实战案例带你⼊⻔ Netty，下篇通过 Netty 源码
分析带你搞清 Netty ⽐较重要的底层原理。
视频的话，⿊⻢的 ⿊⻢程序员 Netty 全套教程 就挺不错的，从 Netty 的基础知识  NIO 讲起，⽐较
容易接受。

你想要对 Netty 掌握的更深的话，推荐你看⼀下这本书。
《跟闪电侠学 Netty：Netty 即时聊天实战与底层原理》
这本书分为上下两篇，上篇通过⼀个即时聊天系统的实战案例带你⼊⻔ Netty，下篇通过 Netty 源码
分析带你搞清 Netty ⽐较重要的底层原理。
视频的话，⿊⻢的 ⿊⻢程序员 Netty 全套教程 就挺不错的，从 Netty 的基础知识  NIO 讲起，⽐较
容易接受。⼯作流（可选）  
国内⽤的⽐较多的开源⼯作流引擎是 Flowable 和 Activiti 这两个，参考资料也蛮多的。Camunda 
也不错，更轻量，功能也很完善，性能和稳定性也很不错。关于开源流程引擎的选择，可以参考这
篇⽂章：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/369761832 。
ps：Flowable 和 Camunda 都是 Activiti5 的⼀个分⽀发展⽽来， 三者的理念有所差别。
国内⽐较⽕的⼯作流引擎 LiteFlow（ https://liteflow.cc/ ） 只做基于逻辑的流转，⽽不做基于⻆⾊任
务的流转。如果你想做基于⻆⾊任务的流转，推荐使⽤ Flowable 和 Activiti 这两个框架。也就是
说，像审批流（A 审批完应该是 B 审批，然后再流转到 C ⻆⾊）这种 LiteFlow 就不适合了。
LiteFlow 适⽤于拥有复杂逻辑的业务，⽐如说价格引擎，下单流程等，这些业务往往都拥有很多步
骤，这些步骤完全可以按照业务粒度拆分成⼀个个独⽴的组件，进⾏装配复⽤变更。
这⾥就不推荐学习资料了，感兴趣的同学可以⾃⼰去找⼀下。
搜索引擎  
搜索引擎⽤于提⾼搜索效率，功能和浏览器搜索引擎类似。⽐较常⻅的搜索引擎是 Elasticsearch
（推荐） 和 Solr。
如果你要学习 Elasticsearch 的话，Elastic 中⽂社区 以及 Elastic 官⽅博客 都是⾮常不错的资源，
上⾯会分享很多具体的实践案例。

这⾥就不推荐学习资料了，感兴趣的同学可以⾃⼰去找⼀下。
搜索引擎  
搜索引擎⽤于提⾼搜索效率，功能和浏览器搜索引擎类似。⽐较常⻅的搜索引擎是 Elasticsearch
（推荐） 和 Solr。
如果你要学习 Elasticsearch 的话，Elastic 中⽂社区 以及 Elastic 官⽅博客 都是⾮常不错的资源，
上⾯会分享很多具体的实践案例。视频教程可以看看尚硅⾕的 《ElasticSearch ⼊⻔到精通》，前⾯基于 ElasticSearch 7.x 讲解，后
⾯加更了 Elasticsearch8.x 新特性。
书籍可以看看《⼀本书讲透Elasticsearch：原理、进阶与⼯程实践》。这本书基于 8.x 版本编写，
⽬前全⽹最新的 Elasticsearch 讲解书籍。内容覆盖 Elastic 官⽅认证的核⼼知识点，源⾃真实项⽬
案例和企业级问题解答。
最后，再推荐⼀些 ElasticSearch 相关的优秀⽂章和专辑来帮助你学习和更好的使⽤ 
ElasticSearch：
Elasticsearch 常⻅⾯试题总结 - JavaGuide
Elasticsearch 基础⼊⻔详⽂ - 腾讯技术⼯程
在⼯作中 ElasticSearch 的⼀些使⽤规范
《滴滴技术的 ES 系列》
《死磕 Elasticsearch 系列》（上百篇 ES 的理论+实战⽂章，全⽹最全⾯的 ES 教程。部分内
容对应的视频教程：https://space.bilibili.com/471049389 ）
分布式&微服务（进阶）  
这部⻔内容涉及到的知识点⽐较多，我这⾥只列举⽐较重要的部分⽐如分布式算法和协议、配置中
⼼、分布式事务。
学习分布式知识，个⼈⽐较建议阅读书籍和博客。当然了，如果⽐较喜欢看视频的话，也可以找⼀
些不错的教程视频或者公开课来看，⽤适合⾃⼰的学习⽅式去学习即可！

分布式&微服务（进阶）  
这部⻔内容涉及到的知识点⽐较多，我这⾥只列举⽐较重要的部分⽐如分布式算法和协议、配置中
⼼、分布式事务。
学习分布式知识，个⼈⽐较建议阅读书籍和博客。当然了，如果⽐较喜欢看视频的话，也可以找⼀
些不错的教程视频或者公开课来看，⽤适合⾃⼰的学习⽅式去学习即可！
书籍推荐（理论向）：《深⼊理解分布式系统》这本书⾮常不错。这本书的作者⽤了⼤量篇幅来介绍分布式领域中⾮常重
要的共识算法，并且还会基于 Go 语⾔带着你从零实现了⼀个共识算法的⿐祖 Paxos 算法。
《从零开始学架构》这本书的内容⽐较全⾯，分布式、微服务、⾼并发、⾼可⽤这些都有涉及到。
这本书对应的是极客时间的专栏—《从零开始学架构》，⾥⾯的很多内容都是这个专栏⾥⾯的，两
者选⼀个阅读就⾏了。
余⽼师的 《软件架构设计：⼤型⽹站技术架构与业务架构融合之道》这本书类似于《从零开始学架
构》，内容同样⽐较全⾯，也很不错。公开课推荐（理论向）：
MIT6.824: Distributed System 这⻔公开课挺经典的。这⻔课每节课都会精读⼀篇分布式系统领域的
经典论⽂，并由此传授分布式系统设计与实现的重要原则和关键技术。
如何的才能更好地学习 MIT6.824 分布式系统课程？
MIT6.824: Distributed System（中⽂翻译 wiki）
MIT6.824: Distributed System - CS ⾃学指南
视频推荐（实战向）：
视频可以直接学习尚硅⾕的 2024 最新版 Spring Cloud 教程，这⻔课程介绍了 SpringCloud 和 
SpringCloud Alibaba 中⽬前最主流的组件。学完了这⻔课程之后，就可以直接上⼿为微服务项⽬的
开发实战了。

stributed System（中⽂翻译 wiki）
MIT6.824: Distributed System - CS ⾃学指南
视频推荐（实战向）：
视频可以直接学习尚硅⾕的 2024 最新版 Spring Cloud 教程，这⻔课程介绍了 SpringCloud 和 
SpringCloud Alibaba 中⽬前最主流的组件。学完了这⻔课程之后，就可以直接上⼿为微服务项⽬的
开发实战了。理论&算法&协议  
⽐较重要的分布式理论&算法&协议有：CAP 理论、BASE 理论、Paxos 算法、Gossip 协议、Raft 
算法等等。
⽂章推荐：
CAP & BASE 理论详解
Paxos 算法详解
Raft 算法详解
Gossip 协议详解
远程调⽤  
不同服务之间的调⽤⼀般有两种⽅法：
RPC：RPC（Remote Procedure Call） 即远程过程调⽤，通过 RPC 可以帮助我们调⽤远程
计算机上某个服务的⽅法，这个过程就像调⽤本地⽅法⼀样简单。Dubbo 是⼀款国产的 RPC 
框架，由阿⾥开源，国内⽤的最多。
HTTP 客户端 ：通过 HTTP 协议调⽤其他服务的 RESTful API。Feign 和 OpenFeign（Spring 
Cloud 官⽅基于 Feign 开发的，⽤于替代已经进⼊停更维护状态的 Feign） 是⽬前最常⽤的 
HTTP 客户端。

助我们调⽤远程
计算机上某个服务的⽅法，这个过程就像调⽤本地⽅法⼀样简单。Dubbo 是⼀款国产的 RPC 
框架，由阿⾥开源，国内⽤的最多。
HTTP 客户端 ：通过 HTTP 协议调⽤其他服务的 RESTful API。Feign 和 OpenFeign（Spring 
Cloud 官⽅基于 Feign 开发的，⽤于替代已经进⼊停更维护状态的 Feign） 是⽬前最常⽤的 
HTTP 客户端。OpenFeign 和 Dubbo 都是⽬前⼴泛应⽤于微服务架构的远程调⽤框架，但两者实现⽅式不同
（OpenFeign 基于 HTTP 协议，Dubbo ⽀持多种协议，还可以⾃定义协议），适合的场景也略有
区别。Spring Cloud 微服务项⽬现在⽤的⽐较多的是基于 Rest ⻛格的调⽤⽅式的 OpenFeign，个
⼈⽐较建议学习这个。
不过，如果你跟着教程做的项⽬⽤的是 Dubbo 或者⼯作需要⽤到 Dubbo 的话，那你可以主要学习 
Dubbo。推荐⼀下我写的总结：
RPC 基础知识总结
Dubbo 常⻅问题总结
另外，Dubbo 官⽅⽂档是⼀定要看的，地址：https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/hom
e/。
服务注册与发现  
Eureka、Zookeeper、Consul、Nacos 都可以提供服务注册与发现的功能。
个⼈⽐较建议学习 Nacos，国内⽤的⽐较多，功能也更强⼤！除了提供服务注册与发现⼯功能之
外，还可以作为配置中⼼使⽤。
学习 Nacos 的话，官⽅⽂档是⼀定要看的：https://nacos.io/zh-cn/docs/v2/quickstart/quick-start.ht
ml 。
另外，再推荐⼀些我觉得还不错的学习资料：
Nacos 架构&原理 - 阿⾥藏经阁（推荐，像 Nacos 内核设计、底层原理、最佳实践）
55 张图吃透 Nacos - 不才陈某
图⽂解析 Nacos 配置中⼼的实现 - 掘⾦（没有过多代码粘贴，原理讲的很清楚）
Nacos 帮我们解决什么问题？—— 配置管理篇 - 阿⾥巴巴中间件
API ⽹关  
⽹关可以为我们提供请求转发、安全认证（身份/权限认证）、流量控制、负载均衡、降级熔断、⽇
志、监控、参数校验、协议转换等功能。
关于 API ⽹关的基础知识和技术选型推荐阅读我写的 API ⽹关基础知识总结这篇⽂章。

API ⽹关  
⽹关可以为我们提供请求转发、安全认证（身份/权限认证）、流量控制、负载均衡、降级熔断、⽇
志、监控、参数校验、协议转换等功能。
关于 API ⽹关的基础知识和技术选型推荐阅读我写的 API ⽹关基础知识总结这篇⽂章。Spring Cloud 微服务项⽬⽐较推荐实⽤ SpringCloud Gateway  作为 API ⽹关，这是 Spring Cloud 
的⼀个全新项⽬，为了取代 Netflix Zuul。为了提升⽹关的性能，SpringCloud Gateway 是基于 
WebFlux 实现。Spring Cloud Gateway 的⽬标是不仅提供统⼀的路由⽅式，并且基于 Filter 链的⽅
式提供了⽹关基本的功能，例如：安全，监控/指标，和限流。
下⾯这些是我觉得还不错的学习资料：

配置中⼼  
微服务下，业务的发展⼀般会导致服务数量的增加，进⽽导致程序配置（服务地址、数据库参数等
等）增多。
传统的配置⽂件的⽅式已经⽆法满⾜当前需求，主要有两点原因：⼀是安全性得不到保障（配置放
在代码库中容易泄露）；⼆是时效性不⾏ （修改配置需要重启服务才能⽣效）。
Spring Cloud Config、Nacos 、Apollo、K8s ConfigMap 都可以⽤来做配置中⼼。
Apollo 和  Nacos 我个⼈更喜欢。Nacos 使⽤起来更加顺⼿，还能顺便作为注册中⼼使⽤，Apollo 
在配置管理⽅⾯做的更加全⾯。
个⼈还是更建议学习 Nacos ,学习资料在上⾯的服务注册与发现已经推荐过了。
分布式 ID  
ID 是数据的唯⼀标识，分布式 ID 是分布式系统下的 ID。
分布式 ID 的解决⽅案有很多，⽐如 ：
算法 ：UUID、Snowflake(雪花算法)
开源框架 ： UidGenerator(百度)、Leaf(美团)、Tinyid(滴滴)、IdGenerator(个⼈)

配置管理⽅⾯做的更加全⾯。
个⼈还是更建议学习 Nacos ,学习资料在上⾯的服务注册与发现已经推荐过了。
分布式 ID  
ID 是数据的唯⼀标识，分布式 ID 是分布式系统下的 ID。
分布式 ID 的解决⽅案有很多，⽐如 ：
算法 ：UUID、Snowflake(雪花算法)
开源框架 ： UidGenerator(百度)、Leaf(美团)、Tinyid(滴滴)、IdGenerator(个⼈)这块内容⽐较简单，推荐阅读下⾯这两篇⽂章进⾏学习：
分布式 ID 介绍&实现⽅案总结
分布式 ID 设计指南
分布式事务  
微服务架构下，⼀个系统被拆分为多个⼩的微服务。
每个微服务都可能存在不同的机器上，并且每个微服务可能都有⼀个单独的数据库供⾃⼰使⽤。这
种情况下，⼀组操作可能会涉及到多个微服务以及多个数据库。
举个例⼦：电商系统中，你创建⼀个订单往往会涉及到订单服务（订单数加⼀）、库存服务（库存
减⼀）等等服务，这些服务会有供⾃⼰单独使⽤的数据库。
那么如何保证这⼀组操作要么都执⾏成功，要么都执⾏失败呢？
这个时候单单依靠数据库事务就不⾏了！我们就需要引⼊ 分布式事务 这个概念了！
常⽤分布式事务解决⽅案有 Seata 和 Hmily。
1. Seata :Seata 是⼀款开源的分布式事务解决⽅案，致⼒于在微服务架构下提供⾼性能和简单易
⽤的分布式事务服务。
2. Hmily : ⾦融级分布式事务解决⽅案。

服务会有供⾃⼰单独使⽤的数据库。
那么如何保证这⼀组操作要么都执⾏成功，要么都执⾏失败呢？
这个时候单单依靠数据库事务就不⾏了！我们就需要引⼊ 分布式事务 这个概念了！
常⽤分布式事务解决⽅案有 Seata 和 Hmily。
1. Seata :Seata 是⼀款开源的分布式事务解决⽅案，致⼒于在微服务架构下提供⾼性能和简单易
⽤的分布式事务服务。
2. Hmily : ⾦融级分布式事务解决⽅案。⽬前国内⽤的⽐较多的是 Seata，建议学习这个。
分布式链路追踪  
不同于单体架构，在分布式架构下，请求需要在多个服务之间调⽤，排查问题会⾮常麻烦。我们需
要分布式链路追踪系统来解决这个痛点。
⽬前分布式链路追踪系统基本都是根据⾕歌的《Dapper ⼤规模分布式系统的跟踪系统》这篇论⽂
发展⽽来，主流的有 Pinpoint，Skywalking ，CAT（当然也有其他的例如 Zipkin，Jaeger 等产品，
不过总体来说不如前⾯选取的 3 个完成度⾼）等。
Zipkin 是 Twitter 公司开源的⼀个分布式链路追踪⼯具，Spring Cloud Sleuth 实际是基于 Zipkin 
的。
SkyWalking 是国⼈吴晟（华为）开源的⼀款分布式追踪，分析，告警的⼯具，现在是 Apache 旗下
开源项⽬。
⽬前国内⽤的⽐较多的是 SkyWalking，建议学习这个。
⾼性能（进阶）  
CDN（掌握概念和原理即可）  
CDN 就是将静态资源分发到多个不同的地⽅以实现就近访问，进⽽加快静态资源的访问速度，减轻
服务器以及带宽的负担。
我们只需要掌握 CDN 的基本概念和原理以及会⽤云⼚商提供的现成 CDN 服务即可，花费不了太多
时间。推荐阅读我写的CDN 常⻅问题总结这篇⽂章。
消息队列  
消息队列在分布式系统中主要是为了异步、解耦和削峰。
常⽤的消息队列如下：
1. RocketMQ ：阿⾥巴巴开源的⼀款⾼性能、⾼吞吐量的分布式消息中间件。
2. Kafka: Kafka 是⼀种分布式的，基于发布 / 订阅的消息系统。

我们只需要掌握 CDN 的基本概念和原理以及会⽤云⼚商提供的现成 CDN 服务即可，花费不了太多
时间。推荐阅读我写的CDN 常⻅问题总结这篇⽂章。
消息队列  
消息队列在分布式系统中主要是为了异步、解耦和削峰。
常⽤的消息队列如下：
1. RocketMQ ：阿⾥巴巴开源的⼀款⾼性能、⾼吞吐量的分布式消息中间件。
2. Kafka: Kafka 是⼀种分布式的，基于发布 / 订阅的消息系统。3. RabbitMQ :基于 erlang 开发的基于 AMQP（Advanced Message Queue ⾼级消息队列协议）
协议实现的消息队列。
4. Pulsar：下⼀代云原⽣分布式消息流平台。
建议选择 RocketMQ 和 Kafka 其中的⼀个进⾏深⼊学习，其他消息队列了解即可。
关于消息队列基础概念、技术选型⽅⾯的介绍，建议阅读我写的消息队列基础知识总结这篇⽂章。
Kafka、RocketMQ、RabbitMQ 学习资源推荐请看知识星球的这篇帖⼦：https://t.zsxq.com/0bEDF

读写分离&分库分表（掌握概念和原理即可）  
读写分离主要是为了将数据库的读和写操作分不到不同的数据库节点上。主服务器负责写，从服务
器负责读。另外，⼀主⼀从或者⼀主多从都可以。
读写分离可以⼤幅提⾼读性能，⼩幅提⾼写的性能。因此，读写分离更适合单机并发读请求⽐较多
的场景。
分库分表是为了解决由于库、表数据量过⼤，⽽导致数据库性能持续下降的问题。

读写分离&分库分表（掌握概念和原理即可）  
读写分离主要是为了将数据库的读和写操作分不到不同的数据库节点上。主服务器负责写，从服务
器负责读。另外，⼀主⼀从或者⼀主多从都可以。
读写分离可以⼤幅提⾼读性能，⼩幅提⾼写的性能。因此，读写分离更适合单机并发读请求⽐较多
的场景。
分库分表是为了解决由于库、表数据量过⼤，⽽导致数据库性能持续下降的问题。常⻅的分库分表⼯具有：sharding-jdbc（当当）、TSharding（蘑菇街）、MyCAT（基于 
Cobar）、Cobar（阿⾥巴巴）...。 推荐使⽤ sharding-jdbc。 因为，sharding-jdbc 是⼀款轻量级 
Java 框架，以 jar 包形式提供服务，不要我们做额外的运维⼯作，并且兼容性也很好。
现在很多公司都是⽤的类似于 TiDB 这种分布式关系型数据库，不需要我们⼿动进⾏分库分表，因
此我们只需要掌握读写分离&分库分表的常⻅概念和原理即可，不需要花费太多时间去实践，推荐
阅读我写的 读写分离&分库分表常⻅问题总结这篇⽂章。
负载均衡  
负载均衡系统通常⽤于将任务⽐如⽤户请求处理分配到多个服务器处理以提⾼⽹站、应⽤或者数据
库的性能和可靠性。
开发过程中，我们接触到的负载均衡可以简单分为 服务端负载均衡 和 客户端负载均衡 这两种。服
务端负载均衡可以通过硬件（⽐如 F5、A10、Array ）或者软件（⽐如 LVS、Nginx、HAproxy ）
实现。Java 领域主流的微服务框架 Dubbo、Spring Cloud 等都内置了开箱即⽤的客户端负载均衡
实现。Dubbo 属于是默认⾃带了负载均衡功能，Spring Cloud 是通过组件的形式实现的负载均衡，
属于可选项，⽐较常⽤的是 Spring Cloud Load Balancer（官⽅，推荐） 和 Ribbon（Netflix，已被
启⽤）。
个⼈建议学习⼀下 Nginx 和 Spring Cloud Load Balancer。
负载均衡的常⻅概念、算法和技术⽅案可以看看这篇⽂章：负载均衡常⻅问题总结。

 属于是默认⾃带了负载均衡功能，Spring Cloud 是通过组件的形式实现的负载均衡，
属于可选项，⽐较常⽤的是 Spring Cloud Load Balancer（官⽅，推荐） 和 Ribbon（Netflix，已被
启⽤）。
个⼈建议学习⼀下 Nginx 和 Spring Cloud Load Balancer。
负载均衡的常⻅概念、算法和技术⽅案可以看看这篇⽂章：负载均衡常⻅问题总结。⾼可⽤（进阶）  
⾼可⽤描述的是⼀个系统在⼤部分时间都是可⽤的，可以为我们提供服务的。⾼可⽤代表系统即使
在发⽣硬件故障或者系统升级的时候，服务仍然是可⽤的 。
限流&降级&熔断  
限流是从⽤户访问压⼒的⻆度来考虑如何应对系统故障。限流为了对服务端的接⼝接受请求的频率
进⾏限制，防⽌服务挂掉。⽐如某⼀接⼝的请求限制为 100 个每秒, 对超过限制的请求放弃处理或
者放到队列中等待处理。限流可以有效应对突发请求过多。
关于服务限流的介绍推荐阅读我写的服务限流详解这篇⽂章，⾥⾯有介绍常⻅的限流算法以及单机
限流和分布式限流的技术⽅案。
降级是从系统功能优先级的⻆度考虑如何应对系统故障。服务降级指的是当服务器压⼒剧增的情况
下，根据当前业务情况及流量对⼀些服务和⻚⾯有策略的降级，以此释放服务器资源以保证核⼼任
务的正常运⾏。
熔断和降级是两个⽐较容易混淆的概念，两者的含义并不相同。降级的⽬的在于应对系统⾃身的故
障，⽽熔断的⽬的在于应对当前系统依赖的外部系统或者第三⽅系统的故障。
Netflix 开源的Hystrix 和阿⾥开源的 Sentinel 都能实现限流、降级、熔断。不过，Hystrix 已经停⽌
维护了，更建议使⽤功能更为强⼤的 Sentinel。另外，Sentinel 的 Wiki 中对⽐了常⽤限流降级组
件，感兴趣的可以看看，传送⻔：常⽤限流降级组件对⽐。
Sentinel 的 wiki 中已经详细描述了其与 Hystrix 的区别，你可以看看。
学习 Sentinel 的话，官⽅⽂档是⼀定要看的：https://sentinelguard.io/zh-cn/docs/introduction.html 
。
另外，再推荐⼀些我觉得还不错的学习资料：

l 的话，官⽅⽂档是⼀定要看的：https://sentinelguard.io/zh-cn/docs/introduction.html 
。
另外，再推荐⼀些我觉得还不错的学习资料：
阿⾥限流神器 Sentinel 夺命连环 17 问？ - 不才陈某
Sentinel 为什么这么强，我扒了扒背后的实现原理 - 三友的 java ⽇志
Sentinel 流控滑动窗⼝算法设计 - ⽼周聊架构
排队另类的⼀种限流，类⽐于现实世界的排队。玩过英雄联盟的⼩伙伴应该有体会，每次⼀有活动，就
要经历⼀波排队才能进⼊游戏。
实现排队的⽅法有很多种，⽐如我们可以借助消息队列、JDK 中的各种阻塞队列。
集群  
相同的服务部署多份，避免单点故障。
超时和重试机制  
⼀旦⽤户的请求超过某个时间得不到响应就结束此次请求并抛出异常。 如果不进⾏超时设置可能会
导致请求响应速度慢，甚⾄导致请求堆积进⽽让系统⽆法在处理请求。
另外，重试的次数⼀般设为 3 次，再多次的重试没有好处，反⽽会加重服务器压⼒（部分场景使⽤
失败重试机制会不太适合）。
云原⽣（可选）  
提示：云原⽣开发对能⼒要求很⾼，Java 后端岗位通常也不会要求云原⽣开发技能。因此，
这部分内容不推荐对云原⽣开发不感兴趣或者不了解的同学学习，可以选择跳过。
云原⽣就是在云中构建、运⾏应⽤程序的⼀套完整的技术体系和⽅法论。这⾥的技术体系和⽅法论
就⽬前来说指的是 微服务+DevOps+持续交付+容器化。
越来越多的编程语⾔、框架开始拥抱云原⽣，例如 Spring 推出了⾯向云原⽣的技术 Spring 
Native、RedHat 开源了 Java 云原⽣服务框架 Quarkus。
如果你对云原⽣领域⽐较感兴趣的话，建议你重点关注下⾯这些技术：
1. 微服务：SpringCloud 或者 SpringCloud Alibaba 其实是不⽤学习的，云原⽣下⼀般基于后⾯提
到的 Kubernetes 来构建微服务。
2. ⽹关：⽹关是整个微服务架构的流量⼊⼝，负责认证授权、请求分发、认证授权、限流、API 
管理、负载均衡等⼯作，是微服务架构中⾮常重要的⼀个组件。因此，我这⾥专⻔单独将⽹关
拿出来提⼀嘴。

趣的话，建议你重点关注下⾯这些技术：
1. 微服务：SpringCloud 或者 SpringCloud Alibaba 其实是不⽤学习的，云原⽣下⼀般基于后⾯提
到的 Kubernetes 来构建微服务。
2. ⽹关：⽹关是整个微服务架构的流量⼊⼝，负责认证授权、请求分发、认证授权、限流、API 
管理、负载均衡等⼯作，是微服务架构中⾮常重要的⼀个组件。因此，我这⾥专⻔单独将⽹关
拿出来提⼀嘴。3. ⽇志和监控告警：Metrics（借助它我们可以在 Grafana 中绘制出各种直观的⾯板，可以更加全
⾯的了解我们系统的运⾏状态）、Trace（借助它我们可以构建出系统调⽤的全貌）、Logs
（⼀些必要的⽇志记录）。
4. 容器：容器技术是云原⽣发展的基⽯，以 Docker 为⾸的容器⼯具提出了“⼀次构建，到处运⾏”
的⼝号。
5. Kubernetes：K8s 被称为云原⽣时代的操作系统，云原⽣应⽤的优势与其提供的功能息息相
关。
6. DevOps：DevOps 关注的是如何实现应⽤程序的全⽣命周期（开发，测试，运维）⾃动化管
理，从⽽实现更快速、更⾼质量、更频繁、更稳定的软件交付。DevOps 团队通常会使⽤微服
务架构来构建应⽤程序，借助于持续集成和持续部署（CI/CD）来实施 DevOps。
7. ServiceMesh：你可以将 Service Mesh 看作是为了简化开发⼯作专⻔抽象出来的⼀层，通常作
为透明的⼀层接⼊到现有的分布式应⽤程序⾥。
8. ……
其中，⽐较重要的是 Kubernetes。如果你做项⽬的话，建议优先考虑 Kubernetes 相关的项⽬。
我之前写过⼀篇⽂章来介绍云原⽣，可以看看： 云原⽣时代，程序员应该掌握哪些能⼒？ 。
另外，还推荐看看这篇：2024年的云原⽣架构需要哪些技术栈。
AI（拓展补充）  
我把 Java 程序员需要重点掌握的 AI 相关技能，分为两⼤⽅向：AI 赋能开发（提升个⼈效率） 和 
AI 应⽤集成（创造业务价值）。
AI 赋能开发  
AI 编程助⼿：GitHub Copilot、Tabnine 等 AI 编程插件以及Augment Code、Cursor、
Windsurf 等 AI 编程 IDE，还有像  Claude Code 这种命令⾏编程助⼿。需要熟练使⽤⾄少⼀款 
AI 编程助⼿，将其融⼊⽇常编码流程。
通⽤⼤语⾔模型 ：如 ChatGPT (OpenAI)、Google Gemini 、Claude。 需要掌握提问的艺术
（Prompt Engineering），能够通过清晰、具体的指令，让 AI ⾼效地为你解决编程和学习中遇
到的问题。
AI 应⽤集成

 等 AI 编程 IDE，还有像  Claude Code 这种命令⾏编程助⼿。需要熟练使⽤⾄少⼀款 
AI 编程助⼿，将其融⼊⽇常编码流程。
通⽤⼤语⾔模型 ：如 ChatGPT (OpenAI)、Google Gemini 、Claude。 需要掌握提问的艺术
（Prompt Engineering），能够通过清晰、具体的指令，让 AI ⾼效地为你解决编程和学习中遇
到的问题。
AI 应⽤集成AI 应⽤开发框架：Spring AI、LangChain4j。强烈推荐 Spring AI。作为 Spring 官⽅推出的 AI 
框架，它不仅能与庞⼤的 Spring ⽣态（如 Spring Boot, Spring Data）⽆缝对接，⽽且未来的
维护更新和社区⽀持也更有保障，是 Java 开发者进⼊ AI 应⽤领域的⾸选。
向量数据库：对于⼤多数 Java 项⽬，我个⼈推荐直接使⽤ PostgreSQL 的 pgvector 插件来实
现向量数据库功能。这种⽅式的优势在于能够复⽤现有的 PostgreSQL 基础设施，极⼤地降低
了技术栈的复杂度和运维成本，⾮常适合项⽬起步和中⼩型应⽤。当然，对于⼤规模、⾼性能
的向量搜索场景，了解并使⽤专业的向量数据库（如 Milvus, Pinecone）也是必要的。
在 Java 中运⾏本地模型 ： 出于数据隐私、成本控制或需要离线运⾏等需求，将 AI 模型直接
部署在本地服务器并通过 Java 应⽤调⽤。 Ollama 极⼤地简化了在本地环境运⾏开源 LLM
（如 Qwen3、Llama 3, Mistral）的流程。Spring AI 和 LangChain4j 都提供了与 Ollama 的原
⽣对接⽀持，使得在 Java 中调⽤本地模型变得异常简单。
更详细的 Java 向 AI ⼤模型应⽤开发学习路线可以参考这篇帖⼦：https://t.zsxq.com/reesk 
（JavaGuide 知识星球专属），介绍了⼤模型应⽤开发基础、Java ⽣态的 AI 开发框架、AI 实战项
⽬推荐以及学习建议，包含具体的学习资料。
总结  
这是⼀份⾮常详细的学习路线，把上⾯的内容学完之后，找到⼀份⽐较好的⼯作已经⽐较容易。
另外，我在上⾯也说了，如果你觉得内容⽐较多⾃⼰学不完或者如果你只想找到⼀份⼩⼚的开发⼯
作的话，建议你把重⼼放在 Java 基础、数据库、常⽤框架、常⽤⼯具上。
像 JVM、分布式、⾼并发、⾼可⽤、微服务这些知识点，如果你想进⼤⼚或者说让⾃⼰在求职的时
候更有竞争⼒，那你就也是要多花⼀点时间来学习的。
现在⾯试很卷，想要找到⼀个好⼯作的话，就需要你去多学⼀点，多练习⼀点。虽然，你⽬前学的
很多知识，在你⼯作之后可能⽤不到，但是，⾯试的筛选就需要你会这些。毕竟，很多岗位是很多
⼈⼀起竞争，为了达到筛选效果，⾯试难度通常都会⽐较⼤的。这也就是所谓的：“⾯试造⽕箭，⼊
职拧螺丝”。

⼒，那你就也是要多花⼀点时间来学习的。
现在⾯试很卷，想要找到⼀个好⼯作的话，就需要你去多学⼀点，多练习⼀点。虽然，你⽬前学的
很多知识，在你⼯作之后可能⽤不到，但是，⾯试的筛选就需要你会这些。毕竟，很多岗位是很多
⼈⼀起竞争，为了达到筛选效果，⾯试难度通常都会⽐较⼤的。这也就是所谓的：“⾯试造⽕箭，⼊
职拧螺丝”。

前言Java 程序员一提起前端知识，心情那是五味杂陈，百感交集。说不学它吧，说不定进公司以后，就会被抓壮丁去时不时写点前端代码说学它吧，HTML、CSS、JavaScript 哪个不得下大功夫才能精通？学一点够不够用呢？如果只学基础的 JavaScript 是不够用的，前端都已经工程化了，Vue、React 这些框架你去看吧，光有点基础根本看不懂，甚至连前端页面路径在哪儿配置，如何跳转都不甚了解，所以得学，而且要学的还不少，请把前端当作 web 不可或缺的一部分来学习。学习前端好处挺多，我听说过这么一句挺有道理的话：一个程序员至少应该掌握一门静态语言，如 Java，还应该掌握一门动态语言，如 JavaScript。而且，你不觉得学了前端，就如打通了程序员的任督二脉，可以独立接活了嘛说不学它吧，说不定进公司以后，就会被抓壮丁去时不时写点前端代码说学它吧，HTML、CSS、JavaScript 哪个不得下大功夫才能精通？学一点够不够用呢？如果只学基础的 JavaScript 是不够用的，前端都已经工程化了，Vue、React 这些框架你去看吧，光有点基础根本看不懂，甚至连前端页面路径在哪儿配置，如何跳转都不甚了解，所以得学，而且要学的还不少，请把前端当作 web 不可或缺的一部分来学习。学习前端好处挺多，我听说过这么一句挺有道理的话：一个程序员至少应该掌握一门静态语言，如 Java，还应该掌握一门动态语言，如 JavaScript。而且，你不觉得学了前端，就如打通了程序员的任督二脉，可以独立接活了嘛这门课为什么不由前端老师来讲？前端老师不知道后端学员的痛点，他认为重要的咱不关心，他认为是常识一带而过的又恰恰是咱迷茫的地方，作为后端老师，我更懂后端学员前端老师不懂后端知识，只能用前端思维来讲前端，如果授课老师懂 Java，能用一些现有知识对比讲解，能起到快速突破的效果前端每个框架动辄需要数十个小时的学习，咱耗不起，我们更希望学到对我们最有用的那部分，其它的省省吧，总不能夺了前端程序员的饭碗前端老师不知道后端学员的痛点，他认为重要的咱不关心，他认为是常识一带而过的又恰恰是咱迷茫的地方，作为后端老师，我更懂后端学员前端老师不懂后端知识，只能用前端思维来讲前端，如果授课老师懂 Java，能用一些现有知识对比讲解，能起到快速突破的效果

知识对比讲解，能起到快速突破的效果前端每个框架动辄需要数十个小时的学习，咱耗不起，我们更希望学到对我们最有用的那部分，其它的省省吧，总不能夺了前端程序员的饭碗前端老师不知道后端学员的痛点，他认为重要的咱不关心，他认为是常识一带而过的又恰恰是咱迷茫的地方，作为后端老师，我更懂后端学员前端老师不懂后端知识，只能用前端思维来讲前端，如果授课老师懂 Java，能用一些现有知识对比讲解，能起到快速突破的效果前端每个框架动辄需要数十个小时的学习，咱耗不起，我们更希望学到对我们最有用的那部分，其它的省省吧，总不能夺了前端程序员的饭碗课程安排整个课程分成五章HTML / CSS 这部分对咱们来说，不是重点，但又不能不讲，这俩知识作为第一章，必学JavaScript 这部分是重点，尤其是 ES6 以后的一些新语法，不理解这些，前端代码你根本看不懂，必学Vue2，Vue3，React 这三章是三选一的关系，根据你入职公司的使用的前端技术不同，有针对地学习后三章会涵盖 TypeScript、VueCli、Vuex、VueRouter、ElementUI、Vite、CreateReactApp、React、Redux、ReactRouter 等库和工具的使用jquery 经过调研，还有一些学员毕业后确实会用到，所以也作为一个可选章节进行学习整个课程分成五章HTML / CSS 这部分对咱们来说，不是重点，但又不能不讲，这俩知识作为第一章，必学JavaScript 这部分是重点，尤其是 ES6 以后的一些新语法，不理解这些，前端代码你根本看不懂，必学Vue2，Vue3，React 这三章是三选一的关系，根据你入职公司的使用的前端技术不同，有针对地学习后三章会涵盖 TypeScript、VueCli、Vuex、VueRouter、ElementUI、Vite、CreateReactApp、React、Redux、ReactRouter 等库和工具的使用jquery 经过调研，还有一些学员毕业后确实会用到，所以也作为一个可选章节进行学习HTML / CSS 这部分对咱们来说，不是重点，但又不能不讲，这俩知识作为第一章，必学JavaScript 这部分是重点，尤其是 ES6 以后的一些新语法，不理解这些，前端代码你根本看不懂，必学

注意：这里计算Conten-Length的时候，用js计算出来的后要加上换行符个数，因为js计算只会默认计算一个换行符。boundary=123 用来定义分隔符起始分隔符是 结束分隔符是boundary=123 用来定义分隔符起始分隔符是结束分隔符是数据格式小结客户端发送编码application/x-www-form-urlencoded ：url 编码application/json：utf-8 编码multipart/form-data：每部分编码可以不同表单只支持以 application/x-www-form-urlencoded 和 multipart/form-data 格式发送数据文件上传需要用 multipart/form-data 格式js 代码可以支持任意格式发送数据编码application/x-www-form-urlencoded ：url 编码application/json：utf-8 编码multipart/form-data：每部分编码可以不同application/x-www-form-urlencoded ：url 编码application/json：utf-8 编码multipart/form-data：每部分编码可以不同表单只支持以 application/x-www-form-urlencoded 和 multipart/form-data 格式发送数据文件上传需要用 multipart/form-data 格式js 代码可以支持任意格式发送数据服务端接收对 application/x-www-form-urlencoded 和 multipart/form-data 格式的数据，Spring 接收方式是统一的，只需要用 java bean 的属性名对应请求参数名即可对于 applicaiton/json 格式的数据，Spring 接收需要使用 @RequestBody 注解 + java bean 的方式

注意，到了框架之后，引入方式会有不同注意，到了框架之后，引入方式会有不同1. 变量与数据类型声明变量1) let :star:let 变量名 = 值;
let 声明的变量可以被多次赋值，例如let 声明的变量可以被多次赋值，例如let a = 100;  // 初始值是 100
a = 200;	  // ok, 被重新赋值为 200
2) const :star:const 修饰的叫常量，只能赋值一次const 修饰的叫常量，只能赋值一次const b = 300; // 初始值是 300
b = 400;	   // error, 不能再次赋值
const 并不意味着它引用的内容不可修改，例如const 并不意味着它引用的内容不可修改，例如const c = [1,2,3];
c[2] = 4; 	        // ok, 数组内容被修改成 [1,2,4]
c = [5,6];			// error, 不能再次赋值
3) varvar 声明的变量可以被多次赋值，例如var f = 100;
f = 200;
基本类型1,2) undefined 和 null执行表达式或函数，没有返回结果，出现 undefined访问数组不存在的元素，访问对象不存在的属性，出现 undefined定义变量，没有初始化，出现 undefined执行表达式或函数，没有返回结果，出现 undefined访问数组不存在的元素，访问对象不存在的属性，出现 undefined定义变量，没有初始化，出现 undefined例

基本类型1,2) undefined 和 null执行表达式或函数，没有返回结果，出现 undefined访问数组不存在的元素，访问对象不存在的属性，出现 undefined定义变量，没有初始化，出现 undefined执行表达式或函数，没有返回结果，出现 undefined访问数组不存在的元素，访问对象不存在的属性，出现 undefined定义变量，没有初始化，出现 undefined例console.log(1);  	// 函数没有返回值, 结果是  undefined
let a = 10;		 	// 表达式没有返回值, 结果是 undefined
let b = [1,2,3];
console.log(b[10]); // 数组未定义元素是 undefined
let c = {"name":"张三"};
console.log(c.age); // 对象未定义属性是 undefined
let d;
console.log(d);		// 变量未初始化是 undefined
二者共同点都没有属性、方法二者合称 Nullish都没有属性、方法二者合称 Nullish二者区别undefined 由 js 产生null 由程序员提供undefined 由 js 产生null 由程序员提供3) string :star:js 字符串三种写法let a = "hello";  // 双引号
let b = "world";  // 单引号
let c = `hello`;  // 反引号
html 代码如下，用 java 和 js 中的字符串如何表示？<a href="1.html">超链接</a>
java 显得比较繁琐String s1 = "<a href=\"1.html\">超链接</a>";

String s2 = """
    <a href="1.html">超链接</a>""";
js 就比较灵活let s1 = '<a href="1.html">超链接</a>';

let s2 = `<a href="1.html">超链接</a>`;
模板字符串（Template strings）需求：拼接 URI 的请求参数，如/test?name=zhang&age=18
/test?name=li&age=20
传统方法拼接

href="1.html">超链接</a>""";
js 就比较灵活let s1 = '<a href="1.html">超链接</a>';

let s2 = `<a href="1.html">超链接</a>`;
模板字符串（Template strings）需求：拼接 URI 的请求参数，如/test?name=zhang&age=18
/test?name=li&age=20
传统方法拼接let name = ; // zhang li ...
let age = ; // 18 20 ...

let uri = "/test?name=" + name + "&age=" + age;
模板字符串方式let name = ; // zhang li ...
let age = ; // 18 20 ...

let uri = `/test?name=${name}&age=${age}`;
4,5) number 和 bigint:star:number 类型标识的是双精度浮动小数，例如10 / 3;   // 结果 3.3333333333333335
既然是浮点小数，那么可以除零10 / 0;	  // 结果 Infinity 正无穷大
-10 / 0;  // 结果 -Infinity 负无穷大
浮点小数都有运算精度问题，例如2.0 - 1.1; // 结果 0.8999999999999999
字符串转数字parseInt("10"); 	// 结果是数字 10 
parseInt("10.5");	// 结果是数字 10, 去除了小数部分
parseInt("10") / 3; // 结果仍视为 number 浮点数, 因此结果为 3.3333333333333335

parseInt("abc");	// 转换失败，结果是特殊值 NaN (Not a Number)
要表示真正的整数，需要用 bigint，数字的结尾用 n 表示它是一个 bigint 类型10n / 3n;			// 结果 3n, 按整数除法处理
6) boolean :star:TruthyFalsyTruthyFalsy在 js 中，并不是 boolean 才能用于条件判断，你可以在 if 语句中使用【数字】、【字符串】... 作为判断条件

果是特殊值 NaN (Not a Number)
要表示真正的整数，需要用 bigint，数字的结尾用 n 表示它是一个 bigint 类型10n / 3n;			// 结果 3n, 按整数除法处理
6) boolean :star:TruthyFalsyTruthyFalsy在 js 中，并不是 boolean 才能用于条件判断，你可以在 if 语句中使用【数字】、【字符串】... 作为判断条件let b = 1;

if(b) { // true
    console.log("进入了");
}
这时就有一个规则，当需要条件判断时，这个值被当作 true 还是 false，当作 true 的值归类为 truthy，当作 false 的值归类为 falsy下面值都是 falsy即长度为零的字符串即长度为零的字符串剩余的值绝大部分都是 truthy有几个容易被当作 falsy 实际是 truthy 的即字符串的 false 和 字符串的零 空数组 空对象即字符串的 false 和 字符串的零空数组空对象7) symbol很少使用 symbol的特点是唯一性，每个通过Symbol创建的值都是独一无二的很少使用 symbol的特点是唯一性，每个通过Symbol创建的值都是独一无二的const sym1 = Symbol();
const sym2 = Symbol();
console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false（每个 Symbol 都是唯一的）
可以传入一个字符串作描述const symWithDesc = Symbol('这是一个描述');
console.log(symWithDesc.description); // "这是一个描述"（ES2019 新增的 description 属性）
console.log(String(symWithDesc)); // "Symbol(这是一个描述)"
注意：即使描述相同，两个Symbol也不相等const symA = Symbol('test');
const symB = Symbol('test');
console.log(symA === symB); // false

sole.log(String(symWithDesc)); // "Symbol(这是一个描述)"
注意：即使描述相同，两个Symbol也不相等const symA = Symbol('test');
const symB = Symbol('test');
console.log(symA === symB); // false
对象类型1) Function :star::star:定义函数function 函数名(参数) {
    // 函数体
    return 结果;
}
例function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
调用函数函数名(实参);
例add(1, 2);     // 返回 3
js 中的函数调用特点：对参数的类型和个数都没有限制，例如add('a', 'b');  // 返回 ab
add(4, 5, 6);   // 返回 9, 第三个参数没有被用到, 不会报错
add(1);			// 返回 NaN, 这时 b 没有定义是 undefined, undefined 做数学运算结果就是 NaN
默认参数java 中（spring）要实现默认参数的效果得这么做：@RestController 
public class MyController {
    
    @RequestMapping("/page")
    @ResponseBody
    public void page(
        @RequestParam(defaultValue="1") int page, 
        @RequestParam(defaultValue="10") int size
    ){
        // ...
    }
}
jsfunction pagination(page = 1, size = 10) {
    console.log(page, size);
}
匿名函数语法(function (参数) {
    // 函数体
    return 结果;
})
例(function(a,b){
    return a + b;
})
第一种场景：定义完毕后立刻调用(function(a,b){
    return a + b;
})(1,2)

匿名函数语法(function (参数) {
    // 函数体
    return 结果;
})
例(function(a,b){
    return a + b;
})
第一种场景：定义完毕后立刻调用(function(a,b){
    return a + b;
})(1,2)
第二种场景：作为其它对象的方法，例如页面有元素<p id="p1">点我啊</p>
此元素有一个 onclick 方法，会在鼠标单击这个元素后被执行，onclick 方法刚开始是 null，需要赋值后才能使用document.getElementById("p1").onclick = (function(){
    console.log("鼠标单击了...");
});
箭头函数(参数) => {
    // 函数体
    return 结果;
}
如果没有参数，() 还是要保留如果只有一个参数，() 可以省略如果函数体内只有一行代码，{} 可以省略如果这一行代码就是结果，return 可以省略如果没有参数，() 还是要保留如果只有一个参数，() 可以省略如果函数体内只有一行代码，{} 可以省略如果这一行代码就是结果，return 可以省略例document.getElementById("p1").onclick = () =>  console.log("aa");
函数是对象以下形式在 js 中非常常见！可以参与赋值，例，具名函数也能参与赋值可以参与赋值，例，具名函数也能参与赋值function abc() {
    console.log("bb");
}

document.getElementById("p1").onclick = abc;
有属性、有方法，执行 ，输出结果如下有属性、有方法，执行 ，输出结果如下

函数是对象以下形式在 js 中非常常见！可以参与赋值，例，具名函数也能参与赋值可以参与赋值，例，具名函数也能参与赋值function abc() {
    console.log("bb");
}

document.getElementById("p1").onclick = abc;
有属性、有方法，执行 ，输出结果如下有属性、有方法，执行 ，输出结果如下ƒ abc()
    arguments: null
    caller: null
    length: 0
    name: "abc"
    ➡prototype: {constructor: ƒ}
    [[FunctionLocation]]: VM1962:1
    ➡[[Prototype]]: ƒ ()
    ➡[[Scopes]]: Scopes[1]
其中带有 f 标记的是方法，不带的是属性带有 ➡ 符号的可以继续展开，限于篇幅省略了带有  的是内置属性，不能访问，只能查看相对重要的是  和  会在后面继承和作用域时讲到其中带有 f 标记的是方法，不带的是属性带有 ➡ 符号的可以继续展开，限于篇幅省略了带有  的是内置属性，不能访问，只能查看相对重要的是  和  会在后面继承和作用域时讲到可以作为方法参数可以作为方法参数function a() {
    console.log('a')
}

function b(fn) {          // fn 将来可以是一个函数对象
    console.log('b')
    fn();                 // 调用函数对象
}

b(a)
可以作为方法返回值可以作为方法返回值function c() {
    console.log("c");
    function d() {
        console.log("d");
    }
    return d;
}

c()()
函数作用域函数可以嵌套（js 代码中很常见，只是嵌套的形式更多是匿名函数，箭头函数）function a() {
    function b() {        
    }
}

函数作用域函数可以嵌套（js 代码中很常见，只是嵌套的形式更多是匿名函数，箭头函数）function a() {
    function b() {        
    }
}
看下面的例子function c() {
    var z = 30;
}

var x = 10;
function a() {
    var y = 20;
    function b() {
        // 看这里
        console.log(x, y);
    }
    b();
}
a();
以函数为分界线划定作用域，所有函数之外是全局作用域查找变量时，由内向外查找在内层作用域找到变量，就会停止查找，不会再找外层所有作用域都找不到变量，报错作用域本质上是函数对象的属性，可以通过 console.dir 来查看调试以函数为分界线划定作用域，所有函数之外是全局作用域查找变量时，由内向外查找在内层作用域找到变量，就会停止查找，不会再找外层所有作用域都找不到变量，报错在内层作用域找到变量，就会停止查找，不会再找外层所有作用域都找不到变量，报错作用域本质上是函数对象的属性，可以通过 console.dir 来查看调试闭包var x = 10;

函数定义时，它的作用域已经确定好了，因此无论函数将来去了哪，都能从它的作用域中找到当时那些变量别被概念忽悠了，闭包就是指函数能够访问自己的作用域中变量函数定义时，它的作用域已经确定好了，因此无论函数将来去了哪，都能从它的作用域中找到当时那些变量别被概念忽悠了，闭包就是指函数能够访问自己的作用域中变量let、var 与作用域如果函数外层引用的是 let 变量，那么外层普通的 {} 也会作为作用域边界，最外层的 let 也占一个 script 作用域

来去了哪，都能从它的作用域中找到当时那些变量别被概念忽悠了，闭包就是指函数能够访问自己的作用域中变量函数定义时，它的作用域已经确定好了，因此无论函数将来去了哪，都能从它的作用域中找到当时那些变量别被概念忽悠了，闭包就是指函数能够访问自己的作用域中变量let、var 与作用域如果函数外层引用的是 let 变量，那么外层普通的 {} 也会作为作用域边界，最外层的 let 也占一个 script 作用域let x = 10; 
if(true) {
    let y = 20;
    function b() {
        console.log(x,y);
    }
    console.dir(b);
}
如果函数外层引用的是 var 变量，外层普通的 {} 不会视为边界var x = 10; 
if(true) {
    var y = 20;
    function b() {
        console.log(x,y);
    }
    console.dir(b);
}
如果 var 变量出现了重名，则他俩会被视为同一作用域中的同一个变量var e = 10; 
if(true) {
    var e = 20;
    console.log(e);	// 打印 20
}
console.log(e);		// 因为是同一个变量，还是打印 20
如果是 let，则视为两个作用域中的两个变量let e = 10; 
if(true) {
    let e = 20;	
    console.log(e);	// 打印 20
}
console.log(e);		// 打印 10
要想里面的 e 和外面的 e 能区分开来，最简单的办法是改成 let，或者用函数来界定作用域范围var e = 10; 
if(true) {
    function b() {
        var e = 20;
    	console.log(e);
    }
    b();
}
console.log(e);

og(e);		// 打印 10
要想里面的 e 和外面的 e 能区分开来，最简单的办法是改成 let，或者用函数来界定作用域范围var e = 10; 
if(true) {
    function b() {
        var e = 20;
    	console.log(e);
    }
    b();
}
console.log(e);	
2) Array :star:语法// 创建数组
let arr = [1,2,3]; 

// 获取数组元素
console.log(arr[0]); // 输出 1

// 修改数组元素
array[0] = 5;		 // 数组元素变成了 [5,2,3]

// 遍历数组元素，其中 length 是数组属性，代表数组长度
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
APIpush、shift、splicepush、shift、splicelet arr = [1,2,3]; 

arr.push(4);    	// 向数组尾部(右侧)添加元素, 结果 [1,2,3,4]
arr.shift();		// 从数组头部(左侧)移除元素, 结果 [2,3,4]
arr.splice(1,1);	// 删除【参数1】索引位置的【参数2】个元素，结果 [2,4]
joinjoinlet arr = ['a','b','c'];

arr.join(); 		// 默认使用【,】作为连接符，结果 'a,b,c'
arr.join('');		// 结果 'abc'
arr.join('-');		// 结果 'a-b-c'

t arr = ['a','b','c'];

arr.join(); 		// 默认使用【,】作为连接符，结果 'a,b,c'
arr.join('');		// 结果 'abc'
arr.join('-');		// 结果 'a-b-c'
map、filter、forEach 注意，前两个个函数都不会改变原数组的属性map、filter、forEach 注意，前两个个函数都不会改变原数组的属性let arr = [1,2,3,6];

function a(i) {   // 代表的新旧元素之间的变换规则
    return i * 10
}

// arr.map(a) // 具名函数，结果 [10,20,30,60]

// arr.map( (i) => {return i * 10} ); // 箭头函数
arr.map( i => i * 10 ); // 箭头函数
传给 map 的函数，参数代表旧元素，返回值代表新元素传给 map 的函数，参数代表旧元素，返回值代表新元素map 的内部实现（伪代码）function map(a) { // 参数是一个函数
    let narr = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let o = arr[i]; // 旧元素
        let n = a(o);   // 新元素
        narr.push(n);
    }
    return narr;
} 
filter 例子let arr = [1,2,3,6];
arr.filter( (i)=> i % 2 == 1 ); // 结果 [1,3]
传给 filter 的函数，参数代表旧元素，返回 true 表示要留下的元素传给 filter 的函数，参数代表旧元素，返回 true 表示要留下的元素forEach 例子let arr = [1,2,3,6];

/*for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}*/

arr.forEach( (i) => console.log(i) );

调用 get，setstu4.name = "小白"

console.log(stu4.name)
特色：属性增删对比一下 Java 中的 ObjectJava 的 Object 是以类作为模板来创建，对象不能脱离类模板的范围，一个对象的属性、能用的方法都是确定好的js 的对象，不需要什么模板，它的属性和方法可以随时加减Java 的 Object 是以类作为模板来创建，对象不能脱离类模板的范围，一个对象的属性、能用的方法都是确定好的js 的对象，不需要什么模板，它的属性和方法可以随时加减let stu = {name:'张三'};
stu.age = 18;					// 添加属性
delete stu.age;					// 删除属性

stu.study = function() {		// 添加方法
    console.log(this.name + "在学习");
}
添加 get，set，需要借助 Object.defineProperylet stu = {_name:null};

Object.defineProperty(stu, "name", {
    get(){
        return this._name;
    },
    set(name){
        this._name = name;
    }
});
参数1：目标对象参数2：属性名参数3：get，set 的定义参数1：目标对象参数2：属性名参数3：get，set 的定义特色：this先来对 Java 中的 this 有个理解

参数1：目标对象参数2：属性名参数3：get，set 的定义参数1：目标对象参数2：属性名参数3：get，set 的定义特色：this先来对 Java 中的 this 有个理解public class TestMethod {

    static class Student {
        private String name;

        public Student(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public void study(Student this, String subject) {
            System.out.println(this.name + "在学习 " + subject);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student stu = new Student("小明");
        
        // 下面的代码，本质上是执行 study(stu, "java")，因此 this 就是 stu
        stu.study("java"); 
    }
}
Java 中的 this 是个隐式参数Java 中，我们说 this 代表的就是调用方法的那个对象Java 中的 this 是个隐式参数Java 中，我们说 this 代表的就是调用方法的那个对象js 中的 this 也是隐式参数，但它与函数运行时上下文相关例如，一个“落单”的函数function study(subject) {
    console.log(this.name + "在学习 " + subject)
}
测试一下study("js");  // 输出 在学习 js
这是因为此时函数执行，全局对象 window 被当作了 this，window 对象的 name 属性是空串

 中的 this 也是隐式参数，但它与函数运行时上下文相关例如，一个“落单”的函数function study(subject) {
    console.log(this.name + "在学习 " + subject)
}
测试一下study("js");  // 输出 在学习 js
这是因为此时函数执行，全局对象 window 被当作了 this，window 对象的 name 属性是空串同样的函数，如果作为对象的方法let stu = {
    name:"小白",
    study
}
这种情况下，会将当前对象作为 thisstu.study('js'); 	// 输出 小白在学习 js
还可以动态改变 thislet stu = {name:"小黑"};
study.call(stu, "js");	// 输出 小黑在学习 js
这回 study 执行时，就把 call 的第一个参数 stu 作为 this一个例外是，在箭头函数内出现的 this，以外层 this 理解用匿名函数let stu = {
    name: "小花",
    friends: ["小白","小黑","小明"],
    play() {
        this.friends.forEach(function(e){
            console.log(this.name + "与" + e + "在玩耍");
        });
    }
}
stu.play()
this.name 所在的函数是【落单】的函数，因此 this 代表 windowthis.name 所在的函数是【落单】的函数，因此 this 代表 window输出结果为与小白在玩耍
与小黑在玩耍
与小明在玩耍
用箭头函数let stu = {
    name: "小花",
    friends: ["小白","小黑","小明"],
    play() {
        this.friends.forEach(e => {
            console.log(this.name + "与" + e + "在玩耍");
        })
    }    
}

玩耍
与小明在玩耍
用箭头函数let stu = {
    name: "小花",
    friends: ["小白","小黑","小明"],
    play() {
        this.friends.forEach(e => {
            console.log(this.name + "与" + e + "在玩耍");
        })
    }    
}
this.name 所在的函数是箭头函数，因此 this 要看它外层的 play 函数，play 又是属于 stu 的方法，因此 this 代表 stu 对象this.name 所在的函数是箭头函数，因此 this 要看它外层的 play 函数，play 又是属于 stu 的方法，因此 this 代表 stu 对象输出结果为小花与小白在玩耍
小花与小黑在玩耍
小花与小明在玩耍
不用箭头函数的做法let stu = {
    name: "小花",
    friends: ["小白","小黑","小明"],
    play() {
        let me = this;
        this.friends.forEach(function(e){
            console.log(me.name + "与" + e + "在玩耍");
        });
    }
}
特色：原型继承let father = {
    f1: '父属性',
    m1: function() {
        console.log("父方法");
    }
}

let son = Object.create(father);

console.log(son.f1);  // 打印 父属性
son.m1();			  // 打印 父方法
father 是父对象，son 去调用 .m1 或 .f1 时，自身对象没有，就到父对象找son 自己可以添加自己的属性和方法son 里有特殊属性  代表它的父对象，js 术语： son 的原型对象不同浏览器对打印 son 的  属性时显示不同Edge Google 打印 console.dir(son) 显示 Firefox 打印 console.dir(son) 显示

}
// cons.prototype 就是父对象
cons.prototype.f1 = "父属性";
cons.prototype.m1 = function() {
    console.log("父方法");
}
配合 new 关键字，创建子对象let son = new cons("子属性")
子对象的  就是函数的  属性JSON之前我们讲 http 请求格式时，讲过 json 这种数据格式，它的语法看起来与 js 对象非常相似，例如：一个 json 对象可以长这样：{
    "name":"张三",
    "age":18
}
一个 js 对象长这样：{
    name:"张三",
    age:18
}
那么他们的区别在哪儿呢？我总结了这么几点本质不同json 对象本质上是个字符串，它的职责是作为客户端和服务器之间传递数据的一种格式，它的属性只是样子货js 对象是切切实实的对象，可以有属性方法语法细节不同json 中只能有 null、true|false、数字、字符串（只有双引号）、对象、数组json 中不能有除以上的其它 js 对象的特性，如方法等json 中的属性必须用双引号引起来本质不同json 对象本质上是个字符串，它的职责是作为客户端和服务器之间传递数据的一种格式，它的属性只是样子货js 对象是切切实实的对象，可以有属性方法json 对象本质上是个字符串，它的职责是作为客户端和服务器之间传递数据的一种格式，它的属性只是样子货js 对象是切切实实的对象，可以有属性方法语法细节不同json 中只能有 null、true|false、数字、字符串（只有双引号）、对象、数组json 中不能有除以上的其它 js 对象的特性，如方法等json 中的属性必须用双引号引起来json 中只能有 null、true|false、数字、字符串（只有双引号）、对象、数组json 中不能有除以上的其它 js 对象的特性，如方法等json 中的属性必须用双引号引起来json 字符串与 js 对象的转换JSON.parse(json字符串);  // 返回js对象

json 中的属性必须用双引号引起来json 中只能有 null、true|false、数字、字符串（只有双引号）、对象、数组json 中不能有除以上的其它 js 对象的特性，如方法等json 中的属性必须用双引号引起来json 字符串与 js 对象的转换JSON.parse(json字符串);  // 返回js对象
JSON.stringify(js对象);  // 返回json字符串
动态类型静态类型语言，如 Java，值有类型，变量也有类型、赋值给变量时，类型要相符int a = 10;
String b = "abc";

int c = "abc";  // 错误
而 js 属于动态类型语言，值有类型，但变量没有类型，赋值给变量时，没要求例如let a = 200;

let b = 100;
b = 'abc';
b = true;
动态类型看起来比较灵活，但变量没有类型，会给后期维护带来困难，例如function test(obj) {
    // obj 的类型未知，必须根据不同类型做出相应的容错处理
}
2. 运算符与表达式位运算、移位运算 :star: :star: :star: :star:解构赋值 :star:位运算、移位运算:star::star::star::star:解构赋值 :star:1) ===严格相等运算符，用作逻辑判等1 == 1    	// 返回 true 
1 == '1'	// 返回 true，会先将右侧的字符串转为数字，再做比较
1 === '1'	// 返回 false，类型不等，直接返回 false
typeof 查看某个值的类型typeof 1	// 返回 'number'
typeof '1'	// 返回 'string'
2) ||需求，如果参数 n 没有传递，给它一个【男】推荐做法function test(n = '男') {
    console.log(n);
}
你可能的做法function test(n) {
    if(n === undefined) {
        n = '男';
    }
    console.log(n);
}
还可能是这样

 '1'	// 返回 'string'
2) ||需求，如果参数 n 没有传递，给它一个【男】推荐做法function test(n = '男') {
    console.log(n);
}
你可能的做法function test(n) {
    if(n === undefined) {
        n = '男';
    }
    console.log(n);
}
还可能是这样function test(n) {
    n = (n === undefined) ? '男' : n;
    console.log(n);
}
一些老旧代码中可能的做法（不推荐）function test(n) {
    n = n || '男';
    console.log(n);
}
它的语法是值1 || 值2
如果值1 是 Truthy，返回值1，如果值1 是 Falsy 返回值 23) ?? 与 ?.??需求，如果参数 n 没有传递或是 null，给它一个【男】如果用传统办法function test(n) {
    if(n === undefined || n === null) {
        n = '男';
    }
    console.log(n);
}
用 ??function test(n) {
    n = n ?? '男';
    console.log(n);
}
语法值1 ?? 值2
值1 是 nullish，返回值2值1 不是 nullish，返回值1值1 是 nullish，返回值2值1 不是 nullish，返回值1?.需求，函数参数是一个对象，可能包含有子属性例如，参数可能是let stu1 = {
    name:"张三",
    address: {
        city: '北京'
    }
};

let stu2 = {
    name:"李四"
}

let stu3 = {
    name:"李四",
    address: null
}
现在要访问子属性（有问题）function test(stu) {
    console.log(stu.address.city)
}
现在希望当某个属性是 nullish 时，短路并返回 undefined，可以用 ?.

let stu2 = {
    name:"李四"
}

let stu3 = {
    name:"李四",
    address: null
}
现在要访问子属性（有问题）function test(stu) {
    console.log(stu.address.city)
}
现在希望当某个属性是 nullish 时，短路并返回 undefined，可以用 ?.function test(stu) {
    console.log(stu.address?.city)
}
用传统办法function test(stu) {
    if(stu.address === undefined || stu.address === null) {
        console.log(undefined);
        return;
    }
    console.log(stu.address.city)
}
4) ...展开运算符作用1：打散数组，把元素传递给多个参数let arr = [1,2,3];

function test(a,b,c) {
    console.log(a,b,c);
}
需求，把数组元素依次传递给函数参数传统写法test(arr[0],arr[1],arr[2]);		// 输出 1,2,3
展开运算符写法test(...arr);					// 输出 1,2,3
打散可以理解为【去掉了】数组外侧的中括号，只剩下数组元素打散可以理解为【去掉了】数组外侧的中括号，只剩下数组元素作用2：复制数组或对象数组let arr1 = [1,2,3];
let arr2 = [...arr1];		// 复制数组
对象let obj1 = {name:'张三', age: 18};

let obj2 = {...obj1};		// 复制对象
注意：展开运算符复制属于浅拷贝，例如let o1 = {name:'张三', address: {city: '北京'} }

let o2 = {...o1};

o1.address.city = '河北';    //这里修o1的属性后，o2的属性也会被改为'河北'
作用3：合并数组或对象合并数组

let obj2 = {...obj1};		// 复制对象
注意：展开运算符复制属于浅拷贝，例如let o1 = {name:'张三', address: {city: '北京'} }

let o2 = {...o1};

o1.address.city = '河北';    //这里修o1的属性后，o2的属性也会被改为'河北'
作用3：合并数组或对象合并数组let a1 = [1,2];
let a2 = [3,4];

let b1 = [...a1,...a2];		// 结果 [1,2,3,4]
let b2 = [...a2,5,...a1]	// 结果 [3,4,5,1,2]
合并对象let o1 = {name:'张三'};
let o2 = {age:18};
let o3 = {name:'李四'};

let n1 = {...o1, ...o2};	// 结果 {name:'张三',age:18}

let n2 = {...o1, ...o2, ...o3}; // 结果{name:'李四',age:18}
复制对象时出现同名属性，后面的会覆盖前面的复制对象时出现同名属性，后面的会覆盖前面的5) [] {}解构赋值[]用在声明变量时let arr = [1,2,3];

let [a, b, c] = arr;	// 结果 a=1, b=2, c=3
用在声明参数时let arr = [1,2,3];

function test([a,b,c]) {
    console.log(a,b,c) 	// 结果 a=1, b=2, c=3
}

test(arr);				
{}用在声明变量时let obj = {name:"张三", age:18};

let {name,age} = obj;	// 结果 name=张三, age=18
用在声明参数时let obj = {name:"张三", age:18};

function test({name, age}) {

ame=张三, age=18
用在声明参数时let obj = {name:"张三", age:18};

function test({name, age}) {
    console.log(name, age); // 结果 name=张三, age=18
}

test(obj)
3. 控制语句:star: :star: :star::star::star::star:1) for in主要用来遍历对象let father = {name:'张三', age:18, study:function(){}};

for(const n in father) {
    console.log(n);
}
其中 const n 代表遍历出来的属性名注意1：方法名也能被遍历出来（它其实也算一种特殊属性）注意2：遍历子对象时，父对象的属性会跟着遍历出来其中 const n 代表遍历出来的属性名注意1：方法名也能被遍历出来（它其实也算一种特殊属性）注意2：遍历子对象时，父对象的属性会跟着遍历出来let son = Object.create(father);
son.sex = "男";

for(const n in son) {
    console.log(n);
}
注意3：在 for in 内获取属性值，要使用 [] 语法，而不能用 . 语法注意3：在 for in 内获取属性值，要使用 [] 语法，而不能用 . 语法for(const n in son) {
    console.log(n, son[n]);
}
2) for of主要用来遍历数组，也可以是其它可迭代对象，如 Map，Set 等let a1 = [1,2,3];

for(const i of a1) {
    console.log(i);
}

let a2 = [
    {name:'张三', age:18},
    {name:'李四', age:20},
    {name:'王五', age:22}
];

for(const obj of a2) {
    console.log(obj.name, obj.age);
}

for(const {name,age} of a2) {
    console.log(name, age);
}

建议安装 LTS（长期支持版）nvm install 16.16.0
nvm install 14.20.0
执行  会列出已安装版本切换到 16.16.0nvm use 16.16.0
切换到 14.20.0nvm use 14.20.0
安装后 nvm 自己的环境变量会自动添加，但可能需要手工添加 nodejs 的 PATH 环境变量2) 检查 npmnpm 是 js 的包管理器，就类似于 java 界的 maven，要确保它使用的是国内镜像检查镜像npm get registry
如果返回的不是 ，需要做如下设置npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org/
3) 搭建前端服务器新建一个保存项目的 client 文件夹，进入文件夹执行npm install express --save-dev
修改 package.json 文件{
  "type": "module",
  "devDependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.1"
  }
}
其中 devDependencies 是 npm install --save-dev 添加的其中 devDependencies 是 npm install --save-dev 添加的编写 main.js 代码import express from 'express'
const app = express()

app.use(express.static('./'))
app.listen(7070)
执行 js 代码（运行前端服务器）node main.js

4) Fetch APIFetch API 可以用来获取远程数据，它有两种方式接收结果，同步方式与异步方式格式fetch(url, options) // 返回 Promise
同步方式const 结果 = await Promise
// 后续代码
await 关键字必须在一个标记了 async 的 function 内来使用后续代码不会在结果返回前执行await 关键字必须在一个标记了 async 的 function 内来使用后续代码不会在结果返回前执行异步方式Promise
	.then(结果 => { ... })
// 后续代码                 
后续代码不必等待结果返回就可以执行后续代码不必等待结果返回就可以执行例：在 express 服务器上有 students.json 文件[
    { "id": 1, "name": "张三", "sex": "男", "age": 18 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "李四", "sex": "女", "age": 17 }
]
现在用 fetch api 获取这些数据，并展示同步方式

待结果返回就可以执行后续代码不必等待结果返回就可以执行例：在 express 服务器上有 students.json 文件[
    { "id": 1, "name": "张三", "sex": "男", "age": 18 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "李四", "sex": "女", "age": 17 }
]
现在用 fetch api 获取这些数据，并展示同步方式<script>
    async function findStudents() {
        try {
            // 获取响应对象
            const resp = await fetch('students.json')

            // 获取响应体, 按json格式转换为js数组
            const array = await resp.json();

            // 显示数据
            const tp = document.getElementById("tp");
            const row = tp.content;
            const [c1,c2,c3,c4] = row.querySelectorAll(".col");
            const tbody = document.querySelector('.tbody');
            for(const {id,name,sex,age} of array) {
                c1.textContent = id;
                c2.textContent = name;
                c3.textContent = sex;
                c4.textContent = age;
                // 复制元素
                const newRow = document.importNode(row, true);
                // 建立父子关系
                tbody.appendChild(newRow);
            }
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
        }

    }
    findStudents()
</script>

在 express 服务器启动代码中加入import {createProxyMiddleware} from 'http-proxy-middleware'

// ...

app.use('/api', createProxyMiddleware({ target: 'http://localhost:8080', changeOrigin: true }));
fetch 代码改为const resp = await fetch('http://localhost:7070/api/students')
或const resp = await fetch('/api/students')
5) 模块化单个导出 const、let、functionexport const a = 10;
export let b = 20;
export function c() {
    console.log('c');
}
一齐导出const a = 10;
let b = 20;
function c() {
    console.log('c')
}

export {a,b,c}
